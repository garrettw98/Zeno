# The Human Standard: Ideological Comparison
## How We Differ from Existing Political Philosophies

---

## Introduction

The Human Standard is not simply a recombination of existing ideologies. It represents a genuinely new synthesis designed for the unique challenges of the automation age. This document clarifies how the Human Standard differs from—and selectively incorporates elements from—existing political philosophies.

### The Core Claim

Every existing ideology was developed for an economy of scarcity where human labor was essential for production. The automation economy fundamentally changes this dynamic. **The Human Standard is the first political philosophy designed specifically for an economy where machines can produce most goods and services.**

## Comparison Matrix

| Issue | Left/Progressive | Right/Conservative | Libertarian | Human Standard |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Role of Markets** | Skeptical, regulate heavily | Generally supportive | Near-absolute | Embrace markets, correct externalities |
| **Government Size** | Larger, more services | Smaller, less spending | Minimal | Right-sized for purpose |
| **Private Property** | Conditional, redistributive | Sacred, protected | Absolute | Protected with responsibilities |
| **Wealth Inequality** | Redistribute aggressively | Natural outcome, accept | Not government's concern | Share automation gains |
| **Social Safety Net** | Extensive, means-tested | Limited, temporary | Private charity | Universal, unconditional |
| **Technology** | Regulate corporations | Let markets decide | Maximum freedom | Democratic governance |
| **Work Ethic** | Structural barriers matter | Character and effort | Personal choice | Meaningful activity varies |
| **Money** | Monetary policy as tool | Stable, limited inflation | Competing currencies | Sound money, limited fiat |
| **Corporations** | Regulate and tax | Enable and protect | Voluntary contracts | Accountability for power |

## Detailed Comparisons

### 1. The Human Standard vs. Democratic Socialism

**Democratic Socialism holds that:**
- Capitalism is inherently exploitative
- Workers should own the means of production
- Major industries should be nationalized
- Markets should be replaced or severely limited
- Profit motive causes harm

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Current distribution of economic gains is unjust
- Workers are losing power relative to capital
- Technology can exacerbate inequality
- Democratic accountability is essential

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Private ownership is inherently problematic
- Markets should be replaced
- Nationalization is the solution
- Profit motive is categorically harmful

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Democratic Socialism | Human Standard |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| Private ownership | Abolish for major industries | Protect with accountability |
| Markets | Replace with planning | Preserve with corrections |
| Profit | Inherently exploitative | Legitimate with proper distribution |
| Solution | Worker ownership | Universal dividend |
| Government role | Direct production | Redistribution and regulation |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

The Human Standard accepts that markets efficiently allocate resources and that private ownership creates useful incentives. The problem isn't capitalism—it's that automation is changing who captures value. Rather than restructure the entire economy, we ensure that automation's gains are shared through taxation and Citizen's Royalty. This preserves the productive benefits of markets while achieving the distributional goals socialism seeks.

### 2. The Human Standard vs. Progressive Liberalism

**Progressive Liberalism holds that:**
- Capitalism can be reformed, not replaced
- Government should actively address inequality
- Social programs should help those in need
- Regulation protects consumers and workers
- Incremental change through existing institutions

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Reform, not revolution, is the path forward
- Government has a role in addressing inequality
- Regulation can protect the public interest
- Existing institutions can be vehicles for change

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Means-tested programs are the best approach
- Current regulatory frameworks are adequate for AI
- Incremental change is sufficient for technological transformation
- Standard policy tools address automation's challenges

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Progressive Liberalism | Human Standard |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|
| Social programs | Targeted, means-tested | Universal, unconditional |
| Tech regulation | Existing frameworks adapt | New AI-specific governance |
| Pace of change | Incremental, cautious | Urgent, transformational |
| Economic model | Managed capitalism | Automation-aware capitalism |
| Citizen's Royalty | Interesting experiment | Core program |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

Progressive liberalism assumes the economy will continue to create adequate jobs and that traditional safety nets can catch those who fall through. The Human Standard recognizes that automation fundamentally changes this equation. We can't just tweak existing programs—we need a new foundation (Citizen's Royalty) and new governance frameworks (AI accountability) designed for a world where machines do most work.

### 3. The Human Standard vs. Conservatism

**Conservatism holds that:**
- Traditional institutions preserve wisdom
- Limited government respects individual liberty
- Markets allocate resources efficiently
- Work builds character and dignity
- Change should be gradual and careful

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Institutions and traditions have value
- Government overreach is a real danger
- Markets are generally efficient
- Work and purpose are important for human flourishing
- Change should be thoughtful

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Markets will automatically handle automation
- Traditional safety nets are adequate
- Resistance to change is always wisdom
- Family stability doesn't require economic security
- Current approaches protect what conservatives value

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Conservatism | Human Standard |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Change | Resist, go slowly | Embrace for survival |
| Markets | Trust to self-correct | Guide through transition |
| Family | Promote traditional values | Enable with security |
| Work | Essential for character | One form of meaning |
| Safety net | Limited, temporary | Universal foundation |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

Conservatives rightly value stable families, meaningful work, and community ties. But automation without intervention will destroy all of these. The Human Standard provides the economic security that allows families to stay together, communities to remain viable, and people to find purpose. It's conservative in the deepest sense: conserving what matters by adapting to change.

### 4. The Human Standard vs. Libertarianism

**Libertarianism holds that:**
- Individual freedom is the paramount value
- Government is the primary threat to freedom
- Markets and voluntary exchange should govern nearly everything
- Property rights are nearly absolute
- Minimal taxation is ideal

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Individual freedom is essential
- Government can be a threat to liberty
- Markets and voluntary exchange have great value
- Property rights are important
- Unnecessary taxation should be avoided

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Corporations and technology can't threaten freedom
- Markets solve all coordination problems
- Economic desperation doesn't compromise freedom
- Collective challenges (AI, automation) require only individual solutions
- All taxation is illegitimate

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Libertarianism | Human Standard |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Threats to freedom | Government primarily | Government AND corporations |
| Citizen's Royalty | Complicated (some support) | Essential |
| Regulation | Almost always bad | Targeted where needed |
| Property rights | Near-absolute | Strong but not unlimited |
| AI governance | Voluntary standards | Democratic accountability |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

The Human Standard takes seriously libertarian concerns about government overreach. That's why we prohibit retail CBDCs, protect self-custody rights, and prefer universal programs over bureaucratic means-testing. But true freedom requires resources, not just the absence of government. Citizen's Royalty provides the economic independence that makes freedom meaningful—including the freedom to say no to bad employers and bad deals.

### 5. The Human Standard vs. Techno-Optimism

**Techno-Optimism holds that:**
- Technology is inherently good and progressive
- Markets will naturally distribute technology's benefits
- Disruption is a feature, not a bug
- Creative destruction creates more than it destroys
- Accelerate technological change

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Technology creates immense potential for good
- Innovation should be encouraged
- Progress is possible and desirable
- Many disruptions have been ultimately beneficial

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Benefits are automatically distributed
- All disruption is beneficial
- Markets handle transition without intervention
- Speed of change is always good
- Technology is neutral or always positive

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Techno-Optimism | Human Standard |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Distribution | Markets handle it | Requires policy |
| Pace | Faster is better | Sustainable is better |
| Disruption | Always creative | Can be destructive |
| Governance | Minimal | Democratic accountability |
| Transition | Self-organizing | Requires support |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

The Human Standard embraces technology but rejects technological determinism. We can choose what kind of technological society we build. The techno-optimist vision where innovation is worshipped and winners take all leads to oligarchy. The Human Standard ensures that technology serves human flourishing for everyone, not just tech elites.

### 6. The Human Standard vs. Techno-Pessimism/Neo-Luddism

**Techno-Pessimism holds that:**
- Technology is destroying what makes life meaningful
- We should resist or slow technological change
- Automation threatens human dignity
- Return to simpler technologies is preferable
- Progress is a myth

**The Human Standard agrees that:**
- Technology can destroy meaning if mismanaged
- Speed of change can be harmful
- Automation poses real risks to dignity
- Not all "progress" is improvement
- Critical evaluation of technology is essential

**The Human Standard disagrees that:**
- Technology is inherently harmful
- We can or should stop technological change
- The past was necessarily better
- Resistance is the best strategy
- Human flourishing requires technological retreat

**Key Distinctions:**

| Issue | Techno-Pessimism | Human Standard |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Technology | Inherently harmful | Can be guided |
| Strategy | Resist and slow | Shape and share |
| Past vs. future | Nostalgic | Forward-looking |
| Human role | Preserve traditional | Adapt and flourish |
| Possibility | Pessimistic | Cautiously optimistic |

**Why Human Standard Is Different:**

We share techno-pessimists' concerns about what unmanaged automation does to human communities. But resistance is futile and nostalgia isn't a policy. The genie won't go back in the bottle. The Human Standard channels technological change rather than fighting it—ensuring that automation serves human needs instead of merely replacing human beings.

## Comparison with Other Citizen's Royalty Proposals

### Andrew Yang / Forward Party

**Yang's approach:**
- Citizen's Royalty of $1,000/month ("Freedom Dividend")
- Value-Added Tax (VAT) as primary funding
- Human-Centered Capitalism framing
- Emphasis on automation and AI
- Forward Party as vehicle

**Human Standard differences:**
- Higher Citizen's Royalty amount (the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) at maturity)
- Automation-specific tax rather than VAT
- Comprehensive AI governance framework (Yang's is less developed)
- Sound money/crypto policy integration
- More detailed implementation plans

**Assessment:** Yang was a pioneer in mainstreaming these issues. The Human Standard builds on his foundation with a more comprehensive and ambitious framework.

---

### Milton Friedman's Negative Income Tax

**Friedman's approach:**
- Negative income tax via IRS
- Replaces welfare programs
- Market-oriented philosophy
- Relatively low guarantee level
- Minimal government expansion

**Human Standard differences:**
- Higher support levels
- Direct payment rather than tax credit
- Doesn't assume market solves everything
- Comprehensive governance beyond just income
- Actively funded by automation taxes

**Assessment:** Friedman's NIT was brilliant for its simplicity and conservative credibility. The Human Standard shares the universality and efficiency goals but recognizes that automation requires more than income support alone.

---

### Charles Murray's Conservative Citizen's Royalty

**Murray's approach:**
- Citizen's Royalty replaces all welfare programs including Social Security
- Mandatory health insurance purchase
- Libertarian framing
- Limited government goal
- Adults only

**Human Standard differences:**
- Stacks with Social Security (doesn't replace)
- Comprehensive rather than replacement approach
- Includes AI governance (Murray doesn't address)
- Includes child benefit
- Recognizes need for transition support

**Assessment:** Murray's work proves Citizen's Royalty can have conservative appeal. The Human Standard is more protective of earned benefits and more comprehensive in scope.

---

### European Basic Income Proposals

**European approaches:**
- Often linked to degrowth/post-work philosophy
- Funded by wealth taxes and general revenue
- Emphasis on environmental sustainability
- Strong labor movement connection
- Less focus on technology

**Human Standard differences:**
- Explicitly technology-focused
- Automation tax as targeted funding
- Maintains work ethic framing
- Sound money rather than MMT
- American political context

**Assessment:** European proposals often have philosophical depth but less attention to implementation and political feasibility in American context.

## What Makes the Human Standard Unique

### 1. Automation-Era Design

Unlike all prior ideologies, the Human Standard is designed specifically for an economy where machines can do most work. We don't retrofit old ideas to new circumstances—we start from the technological reality.

### 2. Comprehensive Integration

Most proposals address Citizen's Royalty OR AI governance OR digital assets OR automation policy. The Human Standard integrates all of these into a coherent framework where policies reinforce each other.

### 3. Both Principled and Pragmatic

We have clear principles (human dignity, democratic accountability, shared prosperity) but translate them into specific, implementable policies with detailed technical and economic analysis.

### 4. Cross-Partisan Appeal

By incorporating legitimate concerns from left, right, and libertarian perspectives, the Human Standard can build coalitions rather than deepen divisions.

### 5. Implementation Focus

We don't just describe the destination—we provide detailed roadmaps for getting there, including political strategy, legislative language, and technical architecture.

## Common Mischaracterizations

### "It's just socialism"
**Wrong.** Private property stays private. Markets set prices. Companies can still profit. We're redistributing productivity gains, not seizing means of production.

### "It's just libertarianism with Citizen's Royalty"
**Wrong.** We believe in regulation where needed, collective governance of powerful technologies, and responsibilities that accompany property rights.

### "It's just techno-utopianism"
**Wrong.** We explicitly recognize technology's dangers and build governance structures to address them. We're cautiously optimistic, not naive.

### "It's just Yang with extras"
**Partial truth.** Yang mainstreamed automation concerns and Citizen's Royalty. We build on that foundation with more comprehensive governance, higher benefit levels, and detailed implementation.

### "It's anti-technology"
**Wrong.** We want technology to flourish—in service of humanity. R&D is exempt from automation taxes. Innovation continues. We're just ensuring everyone benefits.
