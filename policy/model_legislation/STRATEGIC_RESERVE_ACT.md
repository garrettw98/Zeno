# TITLE I—FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND DEFINITIONS

## SEC. 101. FINDINGS

Congress finds the following:

(1) **DOLLAR DEBASEMENT**—The purchasing power of the United States dollar has declined by approximately 96 percent since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, constituting a persistent, hidden tax on savers and wage earners.

(2) **MONETARY MANIPULATION**—The Federal Reserve's unlimited authority to create money has enabled monetary manipulation that transfers wealth from ordinary citizens to those closest to new money creation, a phenomenon known as the Cantillon Effect.

(3) **BITCOIN'S PROPERTIES**—Bitcoin, created in 2009, offers properties superior to fiat currency for certain monetary functions, including absolute scarcity (21 million maximum supply), decentralization, censorship resistance, and programmability.

(4) **STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE**—The United States has established a Diversified Strategic Reserve, recognizing Bitcoin's value as a strategic asset and store of value.

(5) **DEEPFAKE CRISIS**—The proliferation of AI-generated deepfakes threatens the integrity of public discourse, with 133 documented disinformation campaigns using synthetic media in 2024 alone, affecting elections in over 30 countries.

(6) **BLOCKCHAIN VERIFICATION**—Blockchain technology provides immutable, decentralized verification infrastructure that can authenticate content and establish provenance in ways that centralized systems cannot.

(7) **CBDC RISKS**—Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as designed by most nations would enable unprecedented government surveillance and control over citizens' financial lives, threatening privacy and freedom.

(8) **STABLECOIN UTILITY**—Dollar-denominated stablecoins provide the stability of fiat currency with the technological advantages of blockchain, serving as a bridge between traditional and digital finance.

(9) **FINANCIAL INCLUSION**—Digital assets can provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations who lack access to traditional banking.

(10) **INNOVATION LEADERSHIP**—The United States must establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets to maintain global leadership in financial innovation.

## SEC. 102. PURPOSES

(3) to create a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins that protects consumers while enabling innovation;

(4) to prohibit surveillance-enabling Central Bank Digital Currencies;

(5) to enable citizens to receive government payments in digital assets;

(6) to establish national authenticity infrastructure using blockchain technology to combat deepfakes and disinformation;

(7) to create self-sovereign digital identity infrastructure;

(8) to pilot blockchain-based voting systems;

(9) to provide tax clarity for digital asset transactions;

(10) to protect consumers while preserving financial freedom and privacy.
