# TITLE I—ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME

## SEC. 101. FINDINGS

Congress finds the following:

(1) **TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION**—The United States is experiencing an unprecedented technological transformation driven by artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation that is fundamentally altering the nature of work and economic production.

(2) **DISPLACEMENT ACCELERATION**—According to projections from McKinsey Global Institute, Goldman Sachs, and the International Monetary Fund, between 30 percent and 50 percent of current jobs in the United States face significant disruption or elimination due to automation within the next 15 years.

(3) **PRODUCTIVITY-WAGE DISCONNECT**—Labor productivity in the United States has increased by over 60 percent since 1979, while median wages have increased by only 16 percent in real terms, demonstrating that the gains from technological progress are not being broadly shared.

(4) **WEALTH CONCENTRATION**—The top 1 percent of Americans now own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent combined, and this concentration is accelerating as automation shifts returns from labor to capital.

(5) **TAX BASE EROSION**—The Social Security and Medicare trust funds face long-term insolvency as automation reduces payroll tax revenues while the population ages, creating a structural fiscal crisis.

(6) **INADEQUACY OF EXISTING PROGRAMS**—Current safety net programs were designed for an economy with stable long-term employment and do not adequately address the rapid, widespread displacement caused by automation.

(7) **HUMAN DIGNITY**—Every American possesses inherent dignity and worth that is not contingent on their economic productivity, and the United States should ensure that all citizens can meet their basic needs regardless of employment status.

(8) **ECONOMIC STABILITY**—Consumer spending accounts for approximately 70 percent of United States GDP, and maintaining consumer purchasing power is essential for economic stability as traditional employment declines.

(9) **DEMOCRATIC IMPERATIVE**—A democratic society requires that citizens have sufficient economic security to participate meaningfully in civic life without desperation driving political choices.

(10) **PROVEN EFFECTIVENESS**—Pilot programs and studies of unconditional cash transfers, including the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, the Finland UBI experiment, the Stockton SEED program, and the GiveDirectly Kenya program, demonstrate positive outcomes without significant negative effects on work incentives.

## SEC. 102. PURPOSES

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to establish a Universal Basic Income providing a monthly payment to all eligible adult citizens of the United States;

(2) to create sustainable funding mechanisms that capture a share of the economic value generated by automation, data extraction, and carbon emissions;

(3) to ensure that the gains from technological progress are broadly shared among all Americans;

(4) to provide economic security that enables citizens to adapt to technological change, pursue education and training, care for family members, and participate in civic life;

(5) to simplify the existing patchwork of means-tested programs while ensuring no current beneficiary is made worse off;

(6) to maintain work incentives by ensuring that employment always increases total income;

(7) to stimulate economic activity through increased consumer spending;

(8) to reduce poverty, inequality, and the health and social problems associated with economic insecurity;

(9) to preserve individual freedom and dignity by providing unconditional support rather than bureaucratic paternalism; and

(10) to demonstrate American leadership in addressing the economic challenges of the automation age.

## SEC. 106. BENEFIT AMOUNT AND ADJUSTMENTS (VERSION 2.0: NEGATIVE INCOME TAX MODEL)

### (a) NEGATIVE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE
(1) **INCOME FLOOR**—The Citizen's Royalty program shall guarantee a minimum annual income ("Income Floor") for all eligible individuals, payable through a Negative Income Tax mechanism.

(2) **BENEFIT CALCULATION**—For any eligible individual whose annual income falls below the Income Floor, the benefit shall be calculated as:

   **Citizen's Royalty = (Income Floor - Actual Annual Income) × Taper Rate**

(3) **TAPER RATE**—The taper rate shall ensure that benefits gradually decrease as private income increases, maintaining work incentives by ensuring every dollar earned increases total income.

### (b) IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
(1) **PHASE 1** (Years 1-3)—
   - Income Floor: $15,000/year (individual), $22,500/year (couple)
   - Taper Rate: 50%
   - Maximum Annual Benefit: $7,500 (individual), $11,250 (couple)
   - Estimated Annual Cost: $400 billion

(2) **PHASE 2** (Years 4-6)—
   - Income Floor: $18,000/year (individual), $27,000/year (couple)
   - Taper Rate: 50%
   - Maximum Annual Benefit: $9,000 (individual), $13,500 (couple)
   - Estimated Annual Cost: $600 billion

   - Taper Rate: 45%
   - Maximum Annual Benefit: $13,500 (individual), $20,250 (couple)
   - Estimated Annual Cost: $1.2 trillion

### (c) FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY RATIONALE
The Negative Income Tax model costs approximately 60% less than a flat Universal Basic Income of equivalent poverty-elimination impact because:
(1) Benefits are targeted to those with incomes below the floor;
(2) Benefits taper off gradually for those with moderate incomes;
(3) Those above the income floor receive no direct benefit; and
(4) The system integrates with existing tax infrastructure, reducing administrative costs.

### (b) ANNUAL COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT

(2) **ROUNDING**—Any increase under paragraph (1) that is not a multiple of $1 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.

(3) **PUBLICATION**—Not later than November 1 of each calendar year, the Secretary shall publish the adjusted benefit amount that will apply for the following calendar year.

### (c) REVENUE-BASED ADJUSTMENT
(1) **SURPLUS DISTRIBUTION**—If revenues credited to the Automation Dividend Fund in any fiscal year exceed the amounts required to pay benefits and administrative costs under this Act, the Secretary may—
   - (A) increase the monthly benefit amount for the following fiscal year;
   - (B) credit such excess to the Fund's reserve; or
   - (C) implement a combination of subparagraphs (A) and (B).

(2) **SHORTFALL RESPONSE**—If revenues credited to the Automation Dividend Fund in any fiscal year are insufficient to pay full benefits and administrative costs under this Act, the Secretary shall—
   - (A) first, use amounts held in the Fund's reserve;
   - (B) second, borrow from the Treasury, to be repaid from future Fund revenues; and
   - (C) third, if the shortfall is projected to continue for more than 3 consecutive fiscal years, recommend to Congress adjustments to the benefit amount or funding mechanisms.

(3) **PROHIBITION ON REDUCTION**—The monthly benefit amount shall not be reduced below the amount established under subsection (a)(4), as adjusted under subsection (b), except by subsequent Act of Congress.

### (d) REGIONAL COST-OF-LIVING SUPPLEMENT
(1) **AUTHORIZATION**—The Secretary may establish a supplemental payment for eligible individuals residing in areas with costs of living that exceed the national average by more than 25 percent.

(2) **AMOUNT**—Any supplemental payment under this subsection shall not exceed 25 percent of the base monthly benefit amount.

   - (B) direct payments through designated agents, which may include post offices, community organizations, or other entities; and
   - (C) digital currency payment options, if such options are available and requested by the eligible individual.

   - (A) United States dollars;

### (e) EFFECT ON EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
Benefits under this Act shall not be considered earned income for purposes of the earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

## SEC. 302. DEFINITIONS AND CALCULATIONS

### (a) AUTOMATED LABOR VALUE
(1) **IN GENERAL**—The Automated Labor Value of an applicable employer for any taxable year is the value of economic output attributable to automated systems rather than human labor.

(2) **CALCULATION**—Automated Labor Value shall be calculated as follows:

   Where:

   - (B) "Baseline Output per Worker" is the industry baseline established under section 304; and
   - (C) "Imputed Labor Value" is the average compensation (including benefits) per worker in the relevant industry.

(3) **ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION**—At the election of the employer, Automated Labor Value may alternatively be calculated as:

   **ALV = Total Robot Hours × Imputed Hourly Value**

   Where:
   - (A) "Total Robot Hours" is the aggregate operating hours of automated systems performing tasks previously performed by human workers; and
   - (B) "Imputed Hourly Value" is the average hourly compensation for the human position replaced, as determined under section 304.

### (b) AUTOMATED SYSTEM
