# CARBON FEE AND DIVIDEND ACT
## Model Legislation for the Human Standard Framework

---

## TITLE I: SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS

### Section 101. Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Carbon Fee and Dividend Act" or the "Climate Income Act."

### Section 102. Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) Climate change poses a significant threat to the economy, national security, public health, and the natural environment of the United States.

(2) The combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

(3) A carbon fee that reflects the true cost of carbon pollution is the most economically efficient mechanism to reduce emissions.

(4) Returning carbon fee revenue to American households as dividends ensures the transition is fair and progressive.

(5) A border adjustment mechanism prevents carbon leakage and maintains American competitiveness.

(6) Predictable, rising carbon prices provide clear market signals for investment in clean energy.
