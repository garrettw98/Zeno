# FEDERAL LAND VALUE TAX ACT
## Model Legislation for the Human Standard Framework

---

## TITLE I: SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS

### Section 101. Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Federal Land Value Tax Act" or the "Ground Rent Recovery Act."

### Section 102. Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) Land values are created primarily by public investment and community activity, not by individual landowners.

(2) The current property tax system taxes improvements, discouraging construction and economic development.

(3) Land speculation extracts community-created value and contributes to housing unaffordability.

(4) A tax on land values, exclusive of improvements, is economically efficient and cannot be passed on to tenants.

(5) Land is an immovable asset that cannot be hidden or moved offshore, making a land value tax highly enforceable.

(6) Taxing land values rather than improvements encourages productive use of land and discourages speculation.

(7) Revenue from land value taxation provides a stable, progressive source of funding for universal programs.

## ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Revenue Projection

| Year | Rate | Est. Revenue |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | 0.5% | $250-400B |
| 2 | 0.75% | $375-600B |
| 3 | 1.0% | $500-800B |
| 4 | 1.25% | $625B-$1T |
| 5 | 1.5% | $750B-$1.2T |
| 6+ | 2.0% | $1-1.6T |

### Economic Effects

**Positive:**
- Encourages land development and productive use
- Reduces housing costs through increased supply
- Progressive (land ownership concentrated among wealthy)
- Cannot be evaded through offshoring
- Reduces speculation and land banking

**Considerations:**
- Transition affects current landowners
- Agricultural land needs protection
- Assessment accuracy crucial
- State/local coordination required

### Distributional Impact

- Homeowners with low land/improvement ratio: Benefit
- Homeowners with high land/improvement ratio: Modest increase
- Landowners holding vacant land: Significant increase
- Renters: Benefit (lower housing costs, no pass-through)
- Farmers: Protected by reduced rate
