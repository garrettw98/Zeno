# ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
# Universal Basic Income Program
## Comprehensive Projections and Scenario Modeling

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis provides detailed economic projections for the Universal Basic Income program under the American Dividend Act. It examines costs, funding mechanisms, macroeconomic effects, distributional impacts, and long-term fiscal sustainability across multiple scenarios.

**Key Findings**:

1. **Fully Funded**: The combination of automation taxes, data dividend taxes, carbon pricing, and other mechanisms can fully fund Citizen's Royalty at $1,200/month by Year 10.

2. **Net Economic Positive**: Citizen's Royalty generates $1.30-$1.50 in economic activity for every $1 distributed, driven by high marginal propensity to consume among recipients.

3. **Poverty Reduction**: Citizen's Royalty reduces the poverty rate by 60-70%, lifting 25-30 million Americans out of poverty.

4. **Minimal Work Disincentive**: Based on pilot evidence, employment effects are minimal (-1-2% hours worked), with increased entrepreneurship and education.

5. **Inflation Manageable**: Tax-funded Citizen's Royalty is redistributive, not expansionary, resulting in modest inflation (0.5-1.5% additional annually).

6. **Inequality Reduction**: Gini coefficient reduces from 0.39 to 0.32, significant but not dramatic redistribution.

## 5. LABOR MARKET EFFECTS

### 5.1 Employment Effects

**Theoretical Effects**:
- **Income effect**: Citizen's Royalty provides income without work → may reduce labor supply
- **Substitution effect**: Work still increases income → maintains work incentive
- **Security effect**: Basic needs met → enables better job matching
- **Entrepreneurship effect**: Safety net enables risk-taking

**Empirical Evidence** (from pilots):

| Study | Location | Finding |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Finland (2017-18) | National | No significant effect on employment |
| Stockton SEED (2019-21) | California | Full-time employment increased 12% |
| Kenya GiveDirectly | Kenya | Increased work hours and entrepreneurship |
| Alaska PFD | Alaska | Minimal effect on employment |
| Germany (2024) | National | No reduction in work hours |
| OpenResearch (2024) | US | 1.3-1.4 fewer hours worked weekly |

**Projected Effects**:

| Outcome | Year 5 | Year 10 | Year 20 |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| Labor force participation rate | -0.5pp | -1.0pp | -0.5pp |
| Average hours worked | -1.0% | -2.0% | -1.5% |
| Unemployment rate | No change | -0.5pp | -0.5pp |
| Self-employment rate | +1.0pp | +2.0pp | +3.0pp |
| Part-time by choice | +2.0pp | +4.0pp | +5.0pp |

### 5.2 Wage Effects

**Mechanisms**:
1. **Bargaining power**: Workers can refuse bad jobs → higher wages
2. **Reduced desperation**: Less acceptance of exploitative work
3. **Skill development**: Time for training → higher productivity
4. **Business costs**: Some pass through of automation tax

**Projected Wage Effects**:

| Wage Level | Effect | Mechanism |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Minimum wage jobs | +5-10% | Reduced labor supply, better bargaining |
| Median wages | +2-4% | Tighter labor market |
| High wages | 0-2% | Limited effect |
| **Average effect** | **+3-5%** | Weighted average |

### 5.3 Occupational Shifts

**Expected Trends**:
| From | To | Drivers |
|------|-----|---------|
| Low-wage service | Education/training | Security enables investment |
| Multiple gig jobs | Single better job | Reduced desperation |
| Unsafe work | Safer alternatives | Better options |
| Full-time drudgery | Part-time + entrepreneurship | Choice |
| Corporate employment | Self-employment | Security enables risk |

### 5.4 Care Work Recognition

**Current Unpaid Care Work**:
- Childcare: 25 billion hours/year
- Elder care: 10 billion hours/year
- Household work: 30 billion hours/year
- Economic value: ~$1.5 trillion/year

**Citizen's Royalty Effect**: Compensates caregivers directly, recognizing care work value

## 6. INFLATION ANALYSIS

### 6.1 Inflation Mechanisms

**Demand-Pull Inflation**:
- Citizen's Royalty increases consumer spending
- If supply cannot expand, prices rise
- Effect concentrated in supply-constrained sectors

**Cost-Push Inflation**:
- Automation tax → slightly higher production costs
- VAT → directly increases consumer prices
- Higher wages → production cost increases

**Monetary Effects**:
- Tax-funded Citizen's Royalty is redistributive, not expansionary
- No increase in money supply
- Fed can adjust monetary policy if needed

### 6.2 Sector-Specific Inflation

| Sector | Price Effect | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Food | +1-2% | Supply can expand; some labor cost increase |
| Housing | +3-5% | Supply-constrained; concentrated demand |
| Healthcare | +1-2% | Demand increase, but also efficiency gains |
| Education | +2-3% | Increased demand for training |
| Transportation | 0-1% | Automation reduces costs |
| Goods (tradable) | 0-1% | Global competition limits price increases |
| Services (local) | +2-4% | Wage increases pass through |

### 6.3 Aggregate Inflation Projection

**Baseline Inflation**: 2.0% (Fed target)

**Citizen's Royalty Contribution to Inflation**:

| Year | Demand Effect | Cost Effect | Net Inflation Impact |
|------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 5 | +0.3% | +0.2% | +0.5% |
| 7 | +0.6% | +0.4% | +1.0% |
| 10 | +0.8% | +0.5% | +1.3% |
| 15 | +0.6% | +0.4% | +1.0% |
| 20 | +0.4% | +0.3% | +0.7% |

**Total Projected Inflation**: 2.5-3.5% during transition, settling to 2.5-3.0% at steady state

### 6.4 Housing Market

**Special Concern**: Housing is supply-constrained

**Mitigations**:
- Regional cost-of-living supplement (high-cost areas)
- Complementary housing policy (zoning reform, construction)
- Geographic mobility (Citizen's Royalty enables relocation to lower-cost areas)

**Projected Housing Effect**:
| Scenario | Housing Inflation |
|----------|-------------------|
| No mitigation | +5-8% |
| With supply expansion | +2-4% |
| With mobility effect | +1-3% |

### 6.5 Real Value of Citizen's Royalty

| Year | Nominal Citizen's Royalty | Inflation | Real Value (Y1 dollars) |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| 5 | $6,000 | 3.0% | $5,580 |
| 7 | $9,000 | 3.2% | $7,890 |

## 8. SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Scenario A: Automation Accelerates (Optimistic)

**Assumptions**:
- AGI arrives by 2032
- 50% of jobs automatable by 2035
- Automation tax base doubles projections

**Outcomes**:
- Revenue: $4.5T by 2040
- Full Citizen's Royalty funding achieved
- Higher benefits possible ($1,500/month)

### 8.2 Scenario B: Gradual Automation (Base Case)

**Assumptions**:
- Automation continues at current pace
- 30% of jobs significantly affected by 2035
- Tax base grows as projected

**Outcomes**:
- Revenue: $2.5-3.5T by 2040
- Some deficit financing required
- Benefits as planned

### 8.3 Scenario C: Automation Stalls (Pessimistic)

**Assumptions**:
- AI progress slows (regulatory, technical barriers)
- Only 20% of jobs affected by 2035
- Tax base grows slower than projected

**Outcomes**:
- Revenue: $1.8-2.2T by 2040
- Significant deficit financing required
- May need to reduce benefit growth

### 8.4 Scenario D: Economic Crisis

**Assumptions**:
- Major recession (2030 or 2035)
- GDP declines 5-10%
- Unemployment spikes to 15%

**Citizen's Royalty as Automatic Stabilizer**:
- Maintains consumer spending during downturn
- Prevents downward spiral
- Speeds recovery

**Fiscal Effect**:
- Short-term deficit spike
- Faster recovery reduces long-term cost
- Compared to no Citizen's Royalty: Net fiscal benefit

## 10. METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS

### 10.1 Data Sources

| Data | Source | Years |
|------|--------|-------|
| Population projections | Census Bureau | 2020-2050 |
| GDP projections | CBO Long-term Budget | 2020-2050 |
| Income distribution | Census/ACS | 2020-2023 |
| Poverty statistics | Census/SPM | 2020-2023 |
| Automation projections | McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, IMF | Various |
| Pilot study data | Finland, Stockton, Kenya, OpenResearch | Various |
| Tax statistics | IRS, Treasury | 2020-2023 |
| Program costs | OMB, CBO | 2020-2023 |

### 10.2 Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source/Rationale |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| Discount rate | 3% | OMB guidance |
| Productivity growth | 1.5% | Historical average |
| Population growth | 0.5% | Census middle projection |
| Inflation (baseline) | 2.0% | Fed target |
| Automation growth | 15%/yr | McKinsey estimates |
| MPC (average) | 0.72 | Weighted by income |
| Fiscal multiplier | 1.44 | CBO range for transfers |

### 10.3 Model Limitations

1. **Uncertainty in automation trajectory**: The pace of AI/robotics development is inherently uncertain.

2. **Behavioral responses**: Labor supply responses may differ from pilot studies at scale.

3. **Political economy**: Assumes implementation as designed; political changes could alter program.

4. **Global effects**: Analysis focuses on US; international effects not fully modeled.

5. **Technological change**: New technologies may create revenues or costs not anticipated.

### 10.4 Model Validation

- Cross-checked against CBO baseline projections
- Compared to Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates
- Reviewed by academic economists
- Sensitivity analysis conducted on key parameters
