# STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
# The Human Standard Policy Framework
## Coalition Building and Opposition Mapping

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Success of The Human Standard requires building a broad coalition while neutralizing opposition. This analysis maps all relevant stakeholders, their interests, likely positions, and engagement strategies.

**Key Finding**: The Human Standard can build a genuinely cross-partisan coalition because it delivers real value to core constituencies of both parties—economic security for workers (progressive priority), efficient transparent government (conservative priority), individual freedom (libertarian priority), and anti-elite populism (populist priority).
