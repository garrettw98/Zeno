# CONTINGENCY PLANNING: Failure Modes and Backup Systems
## What If Our Assumptions Are Wrong?
### By Zeno

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

No plan survives contact with reality unchanged. The Human Standard framework makes assumptions about technology, economics, and politics that could prove wrong. This document identifies our key assumptions, describes what happens if each fails, and provides contingency plans for each failure mode.

**The Core Principle:** Hope for the best, plan for the worst. A robust political philosophy acknowledges what could go wrong.

## PART II: TECHNOLOGY CONTINGENCIES

### 2.1 What If Automation Is Slower Than Expected?

**Scenario:** Technical challenges, regulatory friction, or economic factors slow automation deployment. By 2035, robot deployment is still limited and AI impact is modest.

**Consequence:**
- Less displacement than projected
- Lower automation tax revenue
- Urgency narrative undermined
- Political momentum lost

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Pivot the Narrative**
   - "We prepared wisely and avoided crisis"
   - Not "we were wrong," but "we were prudent"
   - Continue building infrastructure for eventual transition

2. **Adjust Revenue Sources**
   - Increase reliance on consumption tax, data tax, carbon tax
   - Reduce dependence on automation tax
   - Scale Citizen's Royalty to available funding

3. **Maintain Readiness**
   - Keep Automation Observatory monitoring
   - Preserve trigger mechanisms for escalation
   - Automation could accelerate unexpectedly later

4. **Refocus Messaging**
   - Emphasize current inequality (doesn't require automation)
   - Emphasize AI governance (still relevant)
   - Emphasize sound money (independent benefit)

### 2.2 What If Automation Is Faster Than Expected (AGI Arrives Suddenly)?

**Scenario:** Unexpected breakthrough leads to AGI-level capabilities by 2028-2030. Mass unemployment accelerates far beyond projections. Social systems overwhelmed.

**Consequence:**
- Policies intended for 2035-2040 needed immediately
- Current safety net collapses
- Social unrest increases
- Emergency measures required

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Emergency Citizen's Royalty Deployment**
   - Pre-legislate emergency authority
   - Treasury can deploy emergency payments within 90 days
   - Funded by emergency appropriation or Fed monetization
   - Scale: Emergency NIT floor ($15,000/year) to all adults immediately

2. **Emergency AI Governance**
   - Invoke national emergency powers
   - Mandatory pause on certain AI deployments
   - Rapid NAICO stand-up under executive authority
   - Emergency licensing requirements

3. **Economic Stabilization**
   - Federal job guarantee (immediate employment of last resort)
   - Price controls on essentials (temporary)
   - Rent freezes (temporary)
   - Emergency nationalization authority for essential services

4. **Democratic Preservation**
   - Emergency powers sunset after 2 years
   - Congressional oversight required
   - Judicial review preserved
   - No suspension of civil liberties

### 2.3 What If Open-Source AI Is Weaponized?

**Scenario:** Bad actors use open-source government AI framework to build systems optimized for oppression, surveillance, or manipulation.

**Consequence:**
- Transparency mandate backfires
- International credibility damaged
- Domestic support for open source erodes

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Technical Countermeasures**

   - Modifications are visible through hash differences
   - Certification programs verify compliance
   - "Human Standard Compliant" trademark protected

2. **International Monitoring**
   - Track all deployments globally
   - Report on modifications and misuse
   - Diplomatic pressure on abusers
   - Technology export controls if necessary

3. **Messaging Response**
   - "Misuse of transparency tools doesn't invalidate transparency"
   - "Authoritarians would build surveillance anyway"
   - "Our framework includes protections they removed"

4. **Fallback Position**
   - If problems are severe: Add export controls to framework
   - Require certification for access to updates
   - Create "verified distribution" channel
   - Maintain core open-source commitment domestically

### 2.4 What If Blockchain Infrastructure Fails?

**Scenario:** Fundamental vulnerability discovered in blockchain systems. Major breach undermines trust in provenance infrastructure or digital currency.

**Consequence:**
- Trust infrastructure collapses
- Digital verification unreliable
- Cryptocurrency value crashes
- Diversified Strategic Reserve loses value

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Diverse Infrastructure**
   - Don't depend on single blockchain

## PART III: ECONOMIC CONTINGENCIES

### 3.1 What If Automation Tax Revenue Falls Short?

**Scenario:** Businesses successfully lobby for exemptions, offshore operations, or game the system. Revenue is 50% or less of projections.

**Consequence:**
- Citizen's Royalty funding gap
- Program cuts required
- Political backlash

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Revenue Diversification**
   - Never depend on single source
   - Citizen's Royalty funding from multiple streams:
     - Consumption tax (base load)
     - Data tax (supplementary)
     - Carbon tax (environmental dividend)
     - Financial transaction tax
     - Land value tax
     - Existing income tax (restructured)

2. **Progressive Scaling**
   - Citizen's Royalty amount adjusts to available funding
   - Minimum guarantee: $500/month
   - Target: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model)
   - Scale between based on revenue

3. **Enforcement Enhancement**
   - International coordination against tax havens
   - Destination-based taxation
   - Increased audit resources
   - Whistleblower incentives

4. **Expenditure Reduction**
   - Other programs funded from general revenue
   - Citizen's Royalty replaces some existing programs
   - Administrative costs reduced through automation
   - Means-testing for supplementary benefits (above Citizen's Royalty)

### 3.2 What If Citizen's Royalty Causes Severe Inflation?

**Scenario:** Citizen's Royalty injection of $3+ trillion annually into economy causes sustained inflation of 15%+ annually. Real value of Citizen's Royalty erodes.

**Consequence:**
- Living standards don't improve
- Political backlash
- Currency instability

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Gradual Phase-In**
   - Start with lower Citizen's Royalty amount ($500/month)
   - Increase gradually as economy adjusts
   - Monitor inflation at each stage
   - Pause if inflation exceeds 6%

2. **Monetary Offset**
   - Coordinate with Federal Reserve
   - Monetary policy tightens as fiscal expands
   - Balance inflation and growth
   - Independent Fed maintains credibility

3. **Supply-Side Response**
   - Invest in housing supply (address housing inflation)
   - Invest in healthcare capacity (address healthcare inflation)
   - Invest in food production (address food inflation)
   - Inflation targeted at sources, not just aggregate

4. **Citizen's Royalty Design Modifications**
   - Index Citizen's Royalty to basket of essentials (not CPI)
   - Provide in-kind for highest-inflation categories
   - Means-tested supplement for housing costs
   - Regional adjustment for cost-of-living

5. **Taxation Recapture**
   - If inflation from excess spending, increase consumption tax
   - Tax back inflationary gains
   - Revenue recirculated to Citizen's Royalty fund
   - Self-correcting mechanism

### 3.3 What If Capital Flees?

**Scenario:** Wealthy individuals and corporations relocate to avoid automation tax, data tax, and wealth taxes. U.S. loses tax base and investment.

**Consequence:**
- Revenue drops
- Investment declines
- Economic growth slows
- Political argument against policies

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Exit Taxation**
   - Exit tax on expatriating wealth (already exists for individuals)
   - Extend to corporate inversions
   - Deemed realization of all gains on exit
   - Recovery of prior tax benefits

2. **Destination-Based Taxation**
   - Tax consumption where it occurs
   - If you sell to Americans, you pay American taxes
   - Doesn't matter where company is domiciled
   - Border adjustments for imports

3. **Carrot and Stick**
   - Investment incentives for staying
   - Research and development credits
   - Infrastructure investment

   - Coordinate with allies on tax havens
   - Mutual enforcement agreements
   - Reduce race-to-bottom pressure

5. **Narrative Management**
   - "Capital that demands exploitation can leave"
   - "We're building an economy for workers, not just capital"
   - "Investment follows consumer spending—Citizen's Royalty creates demand"
   - "Companies that want American consumers will stay"

### 3.4 What If Work Disappears Faster Than Meaning Replaces It?

**Scenario:** Jobs disappear before new sources of meaning and purpose emerge. Mass depression, social unrest, and despair even with adequate income.

**Consequence:**

## PART IV: POLITICAL CONTINGENCIES

### 4.1 What If Cross-Partisan Coalition Fails?

**Scenario:** Left and right cannot unite. Each side rejects elements they dislike. Movement becomes identified with one party and opposed by other.

**Consequence:**
- Policies blocked by opposition
- Electoral strategy fails
- Polarization deepens

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Modular Policy Approach**
   - If full package fails, advance components separately
   - Citizen's Royalty could pass with different coalition than AI governance
   - Sound money appeals to different coalition than automation tax
   - Build coalitions issue by issue

2. **State-Level Laboratories**
   - Pursue policies at state level first
   - Blue states implement progressive elements
   - Red states implement libertarian elements
   - Demonstrate success, build support

3. **Partisan Adaptation**
   - If captured by one party, work within it
   - Push that party toward Human Standard ideas
   - Wait for pendulum swing
   - Ideas survive partisan affiliation

4. **Long-Term Perspective**
   - Major policy changes take decades
   - Social Security, Civil Rights, Medicare all faced opposition
   - Continue advocacy regardless of short-term defeats
   - Demographic and economic changes may shift feasibility

### 4.2 What If Constitutional Challenges Succeed?

**Scenario:** Supreme Court strikes down automation tax as unconstitutional, or Citizen's Royalty as beyond federal authority, or AI governance as violating due process.

**Consequence:**
- Core policies invalidated
- Major restructuring required
- Years of delay

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Alternative Legal Structures**
   - Automation tax as income tax (already constitutional)
   - Citizen's Royalty as tax credit (already constitutional)
   - AI governance as condition of federal contracts
   - Work within constitutional constraints

2. **Constitutional Amendment**
   - If policies struck down, pursue amendment
   - Economic Security Amendment (Citizen's Royalty)
   - AI Rights Amendment
   - Long-term strategy, 10-20 year horizon

3. **State Implementation**
   - Many policies can be done at state level
   - State taxation, state Citizen's Royalty supplements
   - State AI governance for state systems
   - Federal grants to incentivize state action

4. **Court Reconstitution**
   - Long-term judicial appointments
   - Shift court composition over time
   - Bring cases with better vehicles
   - Wait for favorable precedent

### 4.3 What If Elite Resistance Is Insurmountable?

**Scenario:** Wealthy donors, corporate lobbying, and media ownership block policies through political influence. Democratic process captured.

**Consequence:**
- Policies never passed despite popular support
- Frustration with democracy increases
- Radical alternatives gain appeal

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Popular Mobilization**
   - Build grassroots power independent of elites
   - Small-dollar fundraising
   - Mass demonstrations
   - Electoral pressure through primaries

2. **Elite Fracture Strategy**
   - Some elites support Human Standard ideas
   - Tech leaders concerned about AI
   - Younger wealthy people more open to change
   - Split opposition, win converts

3. **Crisis Exploitation**
   - Major crises create openings (Great Depression → New Deal)
   - Prepare policies for next crisis
   - Be ready to implement when window opens
   - Don't waste the crisis

4. **Long March Through Institutions**
   - Place Human Standard advocates in key positions
   - Civil service, academia, media, law
   - Shift elite opinion over decades
   - Generational change

5. **Parallel Structures**
   - Build Citizen's Royalty-like systems outside government
   - Philanthropic Citizen's Royalty pilots
   - Mutual aid networks
   - Cooperative businesses
   - Demonstrate viability, build pressure

### 4.4 What If International Coordination Fails?

**Scenario:** Other countries don't adopt similar policies. Race-to-bottom on taxes, regulation. U.S. either isolates or abandons framework.

**Consequence:**
- Competitive disadvantage for U.S.
- Automation benefits flow to least-regulated jurisdictions
- Global inequality worsens

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Unilateral Implementation**
   - Proceed with domestic policies regardless
   - Use border adjustments for trade
   - Lead by example
   - Others may follow success

2. **Coalition of the Willing**
   - Find partners among like-minded countries
   - EU, Canada, Australia, Japan likely allies
   - Coordinate among willing participants
   - Isolate non-participants

3. **Trade Leverage**
   - Access to U.S. market conditional on standards
   - Similar to environmental standards in trade agreements
   - Labor standards in trade agreements
   - AI governance standards in trade agreements

4. **Soft Power**
