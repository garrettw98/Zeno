## Executive Summary

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for establishing the United States' first democratically accountable AI governance framework. Based on the Open Source AI Governance Act and aligned with The Human Standard philosophy, this guide details the practical steps required to:

1. **Establish the National AI Coordination Office (NAICO)** as the central authority for federal AI governance
2. **Build the National AI Repository** as the public infrastructure for transparent AI development
3. **Implement the Algorithmic Decision System (ADS) Framework** for all high-stakes government AI applications
4. **Create the Citizen Rights Portal** enabling every American to understand and challenge AI decisions affecting them
5. **Develop the regulatory infrastructure** for private sector AI accountability

### Key Implementation Principles

- **Open Source First**: All government AI systems default to open source unless national security requires classification
- **Citizen-Centered**: Every implementation decision evaluated against citizen impact and accessibility
- **Iterative Deployment**: Start with pilots, learn, adjust, scale
- **Interoperability**: Build for collaboration across agencies, levels of government, and international partners
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security requirements from inception, not as afterthought

### Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Requirement | Risk if Absent |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Executive Support | Presidential directive, Cabinet buy-in | Agency resistance, resource starvation |
| Congressional Funding | Multi-year appropriations | Start-stop implementation, talent flight |
| Technical Leadership | Recruit world-class AI talent | System failures, security vulnerabilities |
| Agency Cooperation | Cross-agency governance structure | Siloed implementations, duplication |
| Public Trust | Transparent progress reporting | Cynicism, political opposition |

**Standard 2: Explainability Requirements**

```markdown
## Explainability Framework

### Individual Decision Explanations

Every Tier 1 and Tier 2 ADS decision must include:

1. **Decision Summary** (Plain Language)
   - What decision was made
   - Key factors that influenced the decision
   - How the individual's information affected the outcome

2. **Factor Breakdown**
   - Top 5 factors (positive and negative)
   - Relative importance of each factor
   - Comparison to approval/denial threshold

3. **Counterfactual Information**
   - What would need to change for different outcome
   - Specific, actionable when possible

4. **Confidence and Uncertainty**
   - System confidence level
   - Known limitations applicable to this decision
   - Cases where model performs less reliably

### Example Explanation Template

---
**Decision: Disability Benefits - Initial Determination**

**Outcome:** Referred for additional medical review

**Key Factors:**
1. ✓ Medical documentation supports functional limitations (+)
2. ✗ Recent work history suggests potential capacity (-)
3. ✓ Specialist confirms chronic condition (+)
4. ✗ Age category associated with higher recovery rates (-)
5. ✓ Multiple conditions compound functional impact (+)

**What This Means:**
Your application shows strong medical evidence, but the system identified
some factors that need additional review. This is not a denial - a medical
professional will review your complete file within 30 days.

**Your Rights:**
- Request the complete list of factors considered
- Submit additional documentation within 60 days
- Request human review of this initial assessment
- Appeal any final determination

**Confidence:** This recommendation is made with 73% confidence.
Cases similar to yours are correctly classified 85% of the time.

considered and the reasoning applied.

Section 3. Right to Challenge
Every person shall have the right to challenge decisions made
with the assistance of algorithmic or artificial intelligence
systems and to obtain review by a human decision-maker.

Section 4. Right to Non-Discrimination
No algorithmic or artificial intelligence system shall be
deployed in a manner that discriminates on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or
other protected characteristic.
