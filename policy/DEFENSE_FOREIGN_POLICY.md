# DEFENSE & FOREIGN POLICY
## American Power in the Age of AI

---

## Executive Summary

The nature of warfare is changing. AI, autonomous systems, and cyber weapons are reshaping military competition. Great power rivalry with China is the defining challenge. Yet America's defense establishment remains optimized for yesterday's wars. Meanwhile, the international order built after WWII faces unprecedented strain.

**The Zeno Approach:** Adapt American power for the 21st century. Embrace military AI and autonomous systems—ethically and effectively. Compete vigorously with China while avoiding catastrophic war. Rebuild alliances on shared technology and values. Defend the global commons while reducing endless commitments. Lead the world toward AI governance before it's too late.

**Core Principles:**
- **Technological superiority matters** - Win the AI arms race, or lose the peace
- **Great power competition, not war** - Deter China, don't provoke catastrophe
- **Alliances multiply strength** - America is stronger with partners
- **Values aren't weakness** - Democracy promotion serves security
- **Adapt or decline** - The military must transform, not just grow
- **Humans in the loop** - AI enhances, never replaces, human judgment on life/death

## Part II: Defense Transformation

### The Future of Warfare

**Key Trends:**
- AI-enabled systems making decisions faster than humans can process
- Autonomous weapons requiring new doctrine
- Cyber and space becoming decisive domains
- Information warfare increasingly important
- Mass matters—numbers of systems, not just quality
- Speed of conflict accelerating

**The Replicator Imperative:**
Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks (2023): America cannot rely exclusively on existing human-operated weapons systems to prevail against China. "Replicator" initiative aims to field "multiple thousands" of autonomous systems within 18-24 months.

### Policy Framework: Defense Transformation Act

- U.S. policy does NOT prohibit lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS)
- "Human-in-the-loop" not legally required
- ~30 countries call for preemptive ban; U.S. does not support

**The Risks:**
- Autonomous systems may make mistakes at scale
- Speed of autonomous conflict → rapid escalation
- Accountability for autonomous decisions unclear
- Algorithmic bias could cause unintended casualties
- Arms race dynamics with China, Russia

**But Also:**
- Adversaries will develop LAWS regardless of U.S. position

## Conclusion: American Leadership

The 21st century will be shaped by whether democracies or autocracies lead in AI, autonomous systems, and the technologies of the future. America cannot opt out of this competition.

**The Zeno vision:**
- Military superiority through technology, not just spending
- Autonomous systems with ethical safeguards
- China competition without catastrophic war
- Alliances strengthened, not abandoned
- Values as strategic asset
- Nuclear stability preserved
- Veterans and servicemembers honored

America remains the indispensable nation—but only if we adapt. The threats are real. The competition is urgent. And our values, properly applied, are our greatest strength.

Leadership isn't just about power. It's about what you do with it.

## PART VII: COMPUTE BORDER ADJUSTMENT (VERSION 2.6.1)
### Preventing "Runaway Compute" Through Trade Mechanisms

### 7.1 The Offshoring Risk

**The Problem:**

Domestic Thermodynamic Governance creates a competitive disadvantage if other jurisdictions don't follow suit. Companies will offshore AI training to:
- Countries with cheap, dirty energy
- Jurisdictions without compute limits
- Regions with minimal environmental regulation

Result: **"Runaway Compute"**—AI training flees regulation, emissions increase globally, and domestic policy achieves nothing.

**Historical Parallel:**

Manufacturing "pollution havens" emerged when environmental regulation diverged. Companies moved production to avoid compliance costs. We must not repeat this mistake with AI compute.

### 7.2 The Compute Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

**Core Principle:**

> **"To prevent 'Runaway Compute' (the offshoring of model training to evade Thermodynamic Governance), the Human Standard imposes a 'Compute Tariff' on digital imports. Any AI model or service imported from a jurisdiction lacking equivalent Thermodynamic Governance will be tariffed based on the estimated carbon intensity of its training run."**

**Implementation Framework:**

| Import Type | Assessment Method | Tariff Calculation |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AI Model Weights | Training compute estimate × carbon intensity of source grid | $/ton CO2 equivalent |
| AI API Services | Per-query compute × source jurisdiction carbon factor | % of service cost |
| AI-Generated Content | Embedded compute estimation | Flat rate per unit |
| AI Hardware | Embodied energy in manufacturing | Standard import tariff |

### 7.3 Jurisdiction Classification

**Tier 1: Equivalent Governance**
- Jurisdictions with Thermodynamic Governance matching ours
- Zero Compute Tariff
- Mutual recognition agreements

**Tier 2: Partial Governance**
- Some compute limits but below our standard
- Reduced Compute Tariff (proportional to gap)
- Pathway to Tier 1 through policy adoption

**Tier 3: No Governance**
- No meaningful compute energy limits
- Full Compute Tariff
- Strong incentive to adopt standards

### 7.4 Assessment and Enforcement

**Compute Intensity Certification:**

- AI companies must disclose training compute and energy sources
- Third-party auditors verify claims
- Default assumptions (worst-case) for non-disclosing imports
- Fraud penalties for misrepresentation

**Collection Mechanism:**

- Tariff collected at point of import (customs for hardware, digital transaction tax for services)
- Revenue directed to domestic renewable energy development
- Rebates available for verified clean-energy training

### 7.5 WTO Compatibility

**Legal Basis:**

The Compute Border Adjustment is designed for WTO compatibility:

1. **GATT Article XX(b):** "Necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health"
2. **GATT Article XX(g):** "Relating to conservation of exhaustible natural resources"
3. **Non-Discriminatory:** Same standards apply to domestic and foreign AI
4. **Proportional:** Tariff based on actual carbon intensity, not origin

**Precedent:**

The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for steel, cement, and electricity provides legal precedent. Compute CBAM follows similar logic applied to digital goods.

### 7.6 Diplomatic Strategy

**Alliance Coordination:**

- Negotiate Thermodynamic Governance standards with allies first
- Create "Clean Compute Coalition" with mutual recognition
- Present unified front to non-compliant jurisdictions
- Avoid trade war through multilateral approach

**Technology Sharing:**

- Share renewable energy integration expertise
- Support developing nations in clean compute infrastructure
- Avoid neo-colonial dynamics through capacity building
- Goal: Global adoption, not permanent tariff regime
