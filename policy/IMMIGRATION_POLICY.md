# IMMIGRATION POLICY
## Talent, Security, and Humanity

---

## Executive Summary

Immigration policy is broken. Legal immigration is nearly impossible for most. Illegal immigration continues despite enforcement. The system serves neither American workers nor aspiring immigrants. Reform has failed for decades because each side demands everything and accepts nothing.

**The Zeno Approach:** A grand bargain that addresses all legitimate concerns—security, economics, and humanity. Radically expand legal immigration for talent and workers America needs. Secure the border effectively. Create a realistic path for the undocumented already here. Treat all people with dignity.

**Core Principles:**
- **Immigration is American strength** - We are a nation of immigrants
- **Legal pathways must work** - If legal immigration is impossible, illegal immigration is inevitable
- **Security matters** - Borders should be orderly and controlled
- **Economic realism** - Labor markets need workers; protect American wages
- **Humanity always** - Every person deserves dignity regardless of status
- **Integration, not just entry** - Success means becoming American

## Part I: The Current Crisis

### A System That Works for No One

**For High-Skilled Workers:**
- H-1B visa cap: 85,000/year (lottery system)
- Over 750,000 applicants annually for 85,000 spots
- Average wait for Indian-born professionals: 50+ years for green card
- U.S. educates talent, then sends them to compete against us

**For Employers:**
- Can't hire workers legally even with critical shortages
- Process takes years and thousands in legal fees
- Arbitrary denials, policy instability
- Result: Jobs go unfilled or move overseas

**For Low-Skilled Workers:**
- Almost no legal pathway exists
- Agricultural, hospitality, construction rely on undocumented labor
- Exploitation common due to lack of legal status
- Guest worker programs inadequate and bureaucratic

**For Families:**
- Wait times for family visas: 20+ years for some categories
- U.S. citizens wait years to bring spouses, children
- Families separated by dysfunctional bureaucracy

**For Asylum Seekers:**
- Asylum system overwhelmed
- 3+ million case backlog
- Years waiting for hearing
- Legitimate refugees can't access protection

### The 2025 Policy Environment

**Current Administration Actions:**
- $100,000 H-1B fee requirement (September 2025)
- Ended CHNV parole programs for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela
- Declared national emergency at southern border
- Military deployment to border
- Asylum restrictions (fee required, adjudicative holds)
- Remain in Mexico program restored
- Border encounters down to 11,000/month (from 189,000)

**Bipartisan Recognition:**
Both parties agree the system is broken. The Dignity Act of 2025 (bipartisan) proposes comprehensive reform. But partisan gridlock continues.

## Part II: High-Skilled Immigration

### The Talent Competition

The global race for talent is real. Every engineer or scientist who comes to America creates jobs and innovation. Every one we turn away strengthens competitors.

**Current H-1B Problems:**
- Lottery system is arbitrary
- $100,000 fee prices out startups and smaller employers
- Green card backlogs trap talent in limbo
- Country caps create absurd disparities

**Evidence on Impact:**
- H-1B workers don't displace Americans—firms expand when they hire them
- Immigrants start 25% of U.S. companies
- 55% of U.S. billion-dollar startups have immigrant founder
- STEM immigrants generate patents, create jobs

### Policy Framework: The American Talent Act

**Pillar 1: H-1B Reform**

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| 85,000 cap | 200,000 cap (expandable with market demand) |
| Lottery system | Merit-based selection (wage, education, skills) |
| $100,000 fee | Tiered fees: $5K (startups) to $25K (large employers) |
| Employer-tied | Portable after 1 year |
| 3-year term | 5-year term with easier renewal |

**Prioritization Criteria:**
1. Wage level (higher wages = more points)
2. Education (U.S. degree = bonus points)
3. STEM field designation
4. Employer size (bonus for startups/small business)
5. Location (bonus for non-major-metro areas)

**Pillar 2: STEM Green Card Pipeline**

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| Country caps (7% each) | Eliminate country caps |
| 10-50+ year waits | 5-year maximum processing |
| Complex multi-step process | Direct path for STEM PhDs |
| Limited categories | Expanded EB-1 and EB-2 |

**Specific Provisions:**
- Automatic green card for U.S. STEM PhD graduates
- Staple green card to diploma for advanced degrees
- Eliminate per-country limits entirely
- Clear backlog within 5 years

**Pillar 3: Startup Visa**

Currently, no visa exists for entrepreneurs starting companies. Proposed:

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Initial investment | $100,000 (self or outside) |
| Business plan | Reviewed by USCIS or designated entity |
| Initial visa | 2 years, renewable |
| Green card pathway | After creating 5+ U.S. jobs or $500K revenue |

**Pillar 4: International Student Retention**
- Work authorization: 3 years post-graduation (all degrees)
- Streamlined H-1B process for F-1 graduates
- Direct green card path for PhD graduates
- No limit on student visas

**Projected Impact:**
| Metric | Current | 5-Year Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| H-1B visas issued | 85,000 | 200,000 |
| STEM green cards | 140,000 | 300,000 |
| Startup visas | 0 | 25,000 |
| Average green card wait (India) | 50+ years | 5 years |

## Part III: Essential Worker Immigration

### The Labor Reality

Entire sectors of the American economy depend on immigrant labor—agriculture, hospitality, construction, meatpacking, healthcare. Pretending otherwise is fantasy.

**Current Situation:**
- 8 million undocumented workers in U.S. labor force
- Agriculture: 50%+ of workforce unauthorized
- Construction, hospitality: Heavily dependent on immigrants
- Healthcare worker shortages: Critical and growing
- Native-born workers won't fill these jobs at any wage

**Current Legal Pathways (Inadequate):**

| Visa | Annual Cap | Wait Time | Issues |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| H-2A (agriculture) | No cap | Months | Bureaucratic, seasonal only |
| H-2B (non-agriculture) | 66,000 | Lottery | Grossly insufficient |
| Unskilled green cards | ~5,000 | 20+ years | Essentially unavailable |

### Policy Framework: The Essential Workers Act

**Pillar 1: Expanded Guest Worker Programs**

|---------|---------|----------|
| H-2A (agriculture) | ~300,000 | Streamlined, 3-year visas |
| H-2B (other seasonal) | 66,000 | 200,000 |
| New: Essential Worker Visa | 0 | 250,000 |

**Essential Worker Visa Design:**
- 3-year renewable visa
- Portable between employers (prevents exploitation)
- Sectors: Agriculture, construction, hospitality, healthcare, eldercare
- Wage floor: Prevailing wage (protects American workers)
- Path to green card after 5 years continuous employment

**Pillar 2: Wage Protection for Americans**

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Prevailing wage | Required for all employment-based visas |
| Labor market test | Employer must attempt U.S. hiring first |

| Whistleblower protection | Workers can report violations without deportation risk |

**Pillar 3: Healthcare Worker Pipeline**

| Category | Proposal |
|----------|----------|
| Nurses | Dedicated visa category, 50,000/year |
| Home health aides | Essential Worker Visa eligible |
| Physicians (underserved areas) | Expedited green cards |
| Mental health professionals | J-1 waiver expansion |

**Pillar 4: Construction Workforce**

With housing crisis and infrastructure needs:
- Construction worker visa: 100,000/year
- Apprenticeship partnerships with visa pathway
- Prevailing wage requirement
- Safety training mandatory

---

## Part IV: Family Immigration

### Keeping Families Together

Family reunification has been a cornerstone of U.S. immigration since 1965. Current backlogs make it a cruel joke.

**Current Wait Times:**

| Category | Wait Time |
|----------|-----------|
| Married adult children of citizens (Philippines) | 24 years |
| Siblings of citizens (Mexico) | 20+ years |
| Spouses of legal permanent residents | 2+ years |

### Policy Framework: Family Unity Act

**Pillar 1: Clear Backlogs**

- No deportation of parents of U.S. citizen children
- Discretionary relief for long-term residents with family ties
- Hardship waivers streamlined

**Pillar 5: Root Cause Investment**
- $5 billion/year for Central American development
- Anti-corruption programs
- Violence prevention
- Economic opportunity creation
- Address push factors, not just pull factors

---

## Part VI: Border Security

### Effective, Humane Security

Borders should be secure. But security doesn't require cruelty, and enforcement alone doesn't work.

**Current Border Statistics:**
- March 2024: 189,000 encounters
- March 2025: 11,000 encounters (after new policies)
- Reduction driven by: enforcement + reduced legal pathways

**What Works:**
- Legal pathways reduce illegal crossings (when legal entry is possible, people use it)
- Port of entry modernization catches more contraband
- Technology (sensors, drones) more effective than walls in many areas
- Cooperation with Mexico and Central America

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Walls alone (tunnels, ladders, boats)
- Mass detention (expensive, doesn't deter)
- Family separation (cruel, counterproductive)
- Deporting everyone (logistically impossible)

### Policy Framework: Smart Border Security

## Part XII: Integration with Zeno Framework

### Connection to Core Pillars

| Zeno Pillar | Immigration Integration |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Economic Justice** | Immigrant workers protected by wage floors; contribute to economy funding UBI |
| **AI Governance** | E-Verify and processing modernized with AI; bias audits |
| **Human Capital** | Immigrant integration; credential recognition |
| **Climate & Energy** | Climate migrant pathways |
| **Housing** | Immigrant construction workers help build needed housing |

### The Automation Connection

As automation displaces workers:
- High-skilled immigration fills innovation roles
- Some low-skilled jobs remain (caregiving, agriculture)
- Integration programs help all workers adapt
- UBI provides floor for all, regardless of origin

## Conclusion: A Nation of Immigrants

America was built by immigrants. The Statue of Liberty's promise—"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"—is who we are.

**The Zeno vision:**
- Legal immigration that works—fast, fair, predictable
- Talent welcomed and retained
- Workers treated with dignity
- Families kept together
- Refugees protected
- Borders secure but humane
- Those already here given a chance to earn their place
- Integration that builds Americans

This isn't about open borders. It's about smart borders. It's about a system that serves American interests while honoring American values.

The current system serves no one. Reform serves everyone.
