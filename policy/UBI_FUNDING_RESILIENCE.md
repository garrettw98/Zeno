# Citizen's Royalty FUNDING RESILIENCE: Multiple Revenue Streams for Guaranteed Income
## Ensuring the Citizen's Royalty Survives Political and Economic Shocks
### By Zeno

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Citizen's Royalty is the cornerstone of The Human Standard. But a cornerstone must be built on bedrock, not sand. Critics ask: "What if your funding sources don't deliver?" This document provides the answer: **diversified, redundant, and resilient funding architecture.**

**The Core Principle:** Citizen's Royalty must never depend on a single revenue source. Multiple streams ensure that political or economic shocks to any single source don't collapse the program.

---

## PART I: THE FUNDING CHALLENGE

### 1.1 Scale of Need

**Target Citizen's Royalty:** the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) per adult ($24,000/year)
**Adult Population (U.S.):** ~260 million
**Annual Funding Requirement:** $6.24 trillion gross

**Offset by:**
- Existing programs replaced by Citizen's Royalty: ~$1.5 trillion
- Tax recapture from high-income recipients: ~$1 trillion
- Economic growth from Citizen's Royalty spending: ~$500 billion in new revenue
- **Net New Funding Needed:** ~$3.2-3.5 trillion

### 1.2 Why Single-Source Funding Fails

**The Automation Tax Dependency Problem:**

If Citizen's Royalty relies solely on automation tax:
- Automation slower than expected → revenue shortfall
- Businesses successfully lobby for exemptions → revenue shortfall
- Capital flight to tax havens → revenue shortfall
- Constitutional challenge → no revenue

**Any single source creates existential risk to the program.**

## PART II: THE DIVERSIFIED FUNDING STACK

### 2.1 Tier 1: Foundational Revenue (Most Reliable)

These sources are stable, hard to evade, and politically durable:

#### 2.1.1 Value-Added Tax (Consumption Tax)
**Revenue Potential:** $1.5-2.5 trillion/year

**Mechanism:**
- 10-15% federal VAT on goods and services
- Exemptions for necessities (food, medicine, housing under threshold)
- Progressive rates on luxury goods (25%+)

**Why Reliable:**
- Consumption is unavoidable
- Difficult to evade at scale
- Collected at point of sale
- Already works in 170+ countries

**Progressivity:**
- Citizen's Royalty more than offsets VAT for lower/middle income
- Net benefit up to ~$100,000 income
- Net tax above ~$150,000 income
- Highly progressive in combined effect

#### 2.1.2 Land Value Tax
**Revenue Potential:** $500 billion - $1 trillion/year

**Mechanism:**
- Tax on unimproved land value (not buildings/improvements)
- Cannot be passed to renters (inelastic supply)
- Encourages productive use of land

**Why Reliable:**
- Land cannot be moved offshore
- Land cannot be hidden
- Land value is publicly assessable
- Economists across spectrum support it

**Additional Benefits:**
- Reduces speculation
- Encourages development
- Reduces sprawl
- Captures socially-created value

#### 2.1.3 Carbon Tax (Environmental Dividend)
**Revenue Potential:** $200-400 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- $50-150 per ton of CO2 equivalent
- Collected at point of extraction/import
- Rising over time on scheduled path

**Why Reliable:**
- Fossil fuel use is measurable
- Point of collection is limited (wells, ports)
- International border adjustments possible
- Already works in multiple countries

**Additional Benefits:**
- Reduces emissions
- Funds transition to clean energy
- Public support for dividend distribution
- Bipartisan appeal (carbon fee + dividend model)

### 2.2 Tier 2: Growth-Linked Revenue (Captures Automation Value)

These sources grow with automation and AI deployment:

#### 2.2.1 Automation Productivity Tax
**Revenue Potential:** $200-600 billion/year (by 2035)

**Mechanism:**
- Tax on productivity gains above industry baseline
- Equivalent to "robot payroll tax"
- Phased in as automation deployment grows

**Why Important:**
- Directly captures automation value
- Creates equivalence with human labor taxation
- Revenue grows with automation
- Funds the transition it's responding to

**Vulnerability:**
- Depends on automation pace
- Subject to gaming/evasion
- Needs international coordination
- Not sufficient as sole source

#### 2.2.2 Data Dividend Tax
**Revenue Potential:** $100-300 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- Tax on revenue derived from user data monetization
- 7.5-15% on targeted advertising revenue
- 10-20% on data licensing
- 15-25% on AI training data use

**Why Important:**
- Captures value of citizen data
- Creates citizen ownership stake
- Targets highly profitable industry
- Difficult to relocate away from U.S. market

**Vulnerability:**
- Tech industry lobbying
- Definitional challenges
- International coordination needed
- Subject to business model changes

#### 2.2.3 Financial Transaction Tax
**Revenue Potential:** $100-200 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- 0.1% tax on stock trades
- 0.01% tax on bond trades
- 0.001% tax on derivative trades

**Why Important:**
- Enormous volume of transactions
- Reduces harmful high-frequency trading
- Already exists in many countries
- Difficult to evade (exchange-based)

**Vulnerability:**
- Financial industry opposition
- Trading could move offshore
- May reduce market liquidity
- Subject to avoidance strategies

### 2.3 Tier 3: Progressive Revenue (Reduces Inequality)

These sources target concentrated wealth:

#### 2.3.1 Wealth Tax on Ultra-High Net Worth
**Revenue Potential:** $200-400 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- 2-3% annual tax on wealth above $50 million
- 4-5% on wealth above $500 million
- 6-8% on wealth above $1 billion

**Why Important:**
- Reduces wealth concentration
- Ensures billionaires contribute proportionally
- Funds Citizen's Royalty from those who benefit most from automation
- Creates stake in system for all

**Vulnerability:**
- Constitutional challenges (direct tax)
- Valuation difficulties
- Capital flight risk
- Enforcement challenges

**Mitigation:**
- Structure as mark-to-market income tax
- Robust enforcement and exit taxes
- International coordination

#### 2.3.2 Inheritance Tax Reform
**Revenue Potential:** $50-150 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- Lower exemption ($5 million from $13 million)
- Higher rates above exemption (45-65%)
- Close trust loopholes
- Include unrealized gains

**Why Important:**
- Prevents dynastic wealth
- Ensures equal opportunity
- Captures value at death
- Traditional American value (Jefferson, Carnegie)

**Vulnerability:**
- "Death tax" political opposition
- Avoidance through trusts
- Family business concerns
- Estate planning industry

#### 2.3.3 Carried Interest and Capital Gains Reform
**Revenue Potential:** $100-200 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- Tax capital gains as ordinary income (above $1M)
- Eliminate carried interest loophole
- Tax unrealized gains at death
- Mark-to-market for liquid assets

**Why Important:**
- Closes unfair loopholes
- Treats investment income like work income
- Reduces incentive for asset hoarding
- Widely popular reform

**Vulnerability:**
- Financial industry opposition
- Lock-in effects
- Complexity
- Realization timing games

### 2.4 Tier 4: Existing Revenue (Redirected)

These sources come from restructuring current spending:

#### 2.4.1 Program Consolidation
**Revenue Potential:** $800 billion - $1.2 trillion/year

**Programs Citizen's Royalty Can Replace:**
- SNAP (food stamps): $120 billion
- SSI (Supplemental Security Income): $60 billion
- TANF (welfare): $30 billion
- Housing assistance (partial): $50 billion
- EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit): $70 billion
- Various other programs: $100+ billion

**Why Important:**
- Reduces bureaucracy
- Eliminates stigma
- Simplifies system
- Redirects existing spending

**Note:**
- Social Security and Medicare NOT replaced
- Disability accommodations maintained separately
- Housing assistance supplemented, not fully replaced
- Medicaid remains (healthcare separate from income)

#### 2.4.2 Defense Spending Reallocation
**Revenue Potential:** $100-200 billion/year

**Mechanism:**
- Modest reduction in defense spending (10-15%)
- Focus on actual defense needs vs. contractor profits
- Audit-driven efficiency gains
- End unnecessary foreign commitments

**Why Important:**
- Defense budget is massive ($900B+)
- Significant waste and redundancy
- Bipartisan concern about spending
- Reallocation, not elimination

**Vulnerability:**
- Defense industry lobbying
- Security concerns
- Job losses in defense communities
- Political difficulty

## PART III: FUNDING RESILIENCE ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 The Redundancy Principle

**No single source exceeds 30% of total Citizen's Royalty funding.**

| Revenue Source | Target % | Failure Impact |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Consumption Tax (VAT) | 25-30% | Program continues at 70-75% |
| Land Value Tax | 10-15% | Program continues at 85-90% |
| Carbon Tax | 5-10% | Program continues at 90-95% |
| Automation Tax | 10-15% | Program continues at 85-90% |
| Data Tax | 5-10% | Program continues at 90-95% |
| Financial Transaction Tax | 5% | Program continues at 95% |
| Wealth/Inheritance Taxes | 10-15% | Program continues at 85-90% |
| Program Consolidation | 20-25% | Program continues at 75-80% |

**Key Insight:** If ANY single source fails completely, Citizen's Royalty continues at reduced but functional level. No single point of failure.

### 3.2 The Stabilization Fund

**Mechanism:** Build a Citizen's Royalty Stabilization Fund (similar to Social Security Trust Fund)

**Design:**
- Target: 2 years of full Citizen's Royalty payments (~$12 trillion)
- Funded by surplus revenue in good years
- Drawn down during revenue shortfalls
- Invested in safe assets (Treasury bonds, TIPS)

**Operation:**
- Revenue exceeds need → surplus to fund
- Revenue falls short → draw from fund
- Fund depleted → trigger automatic revenue adjustments
- Fund excess → increase Citizen's Royalty or reduce taxes

### 3.3 Automatic Stabilizers

**Built-In Adjustments:**

1. **Citizen's Royalty Amount Adjustment**
   - NIT floor guaranteed ($15,000/year Phase 1)
   - Floor increases based on revenue (up to $30,000/year)
   - Total adjusts automatically, no Congressional action

2. **Tax Rate Adjustment**
   - If revenue falls below threshold, rates automatically increase
   - If revenue exceeds threshold, rates automatically decrease
   - Prevents political gridlock

3. **Means-Testing Trigger**
   - If revenue severely constrained, means-test supplementary amount
   - Base amount remains universal
   - Last resort, automatically reversed when revenue recovers

---

## PART IV: POLITICAL RESILIENCE

### 4.1 Constitutional Protection

**Design for Durability:**

1. **Entitlement Structure**
   - Citizen's Royalty as legal entitlement, not discretionary spending
   - Cannot be cut without affirmative Congressional action
   - Similar to Social Security's protected status

2. **Trust Fund Separation**
   - Dedicated trust fund separate from general revenue
   - Trustees report annually on solvency
   - Public accountability for any threats to funding

3. **Constitutional Amendment (Long-Term)**
   - Economic Security Amendment
   - Enshrines right to basic income
   - Requires supermajority to modify
   - Removes from ordinary political process

### 4.2 Broad Coalition Support

**Design for Political Durability:**

1. **Universality**
   - Everyone receives it (no stigma)
   - Everyone has stake in preserving it
   - Rich and poor both benefit
   - No "us vs. them" politics

2. **Simplicity**
   - Easy to understand
   - Hard to demagogue
   - Monthly check, same amount
   - No bureaucratic nightmares to attack

3. **Multiple Revenue Sources**
   - Each source has its own constituency
   - No single industry targeted
   - Balanced burden across economy
   - Hard to build unified opposition

### 4.3 Path Dependency

**Once Implemented, Hard to Reverse:**

- 260 million people receiving monthly checks
- Businesses adapt to consumer spending patterns
- Housing, healthcare, education markets adjust
- Local economies depend on Citizen's Royalty spending
- Political suicide to eliminate

**The Social Security Precedent:**
- Called "socialism" when proposed
- Now untouchable "third rail"
- Politicians compete to protect it
- Citizen's Royalty can achieve same status

## CONCLUSION

**The Funding Question Is Answered:**

Citizen's Royalty is funded through **diversified, redundant, and resilient** revenue streams:

1. **Tier 1 (Stable):** Consumption tax, land value tax, carbon tax
2. **Tier 2 (Growth):** Automation tax, data tax, financial transaction tax
3. **Tier 3 (Progressive):** Wealth tax, inheritance tax, capital gains reform
4. **Tier 4 (Existing):** Program consolidation, spending reallocation

**No single source can fail catastrophically.** The program continues even under adverse conditions.

**Political resilience** is built in through universality, simplicity, trust fund structure, and broad coalition support.

**The Human Standard Citizen's Royalty is not a utopian dream dependent on perfect conditions. It is an engineered system designed to survive real-world political and economic stress.**
