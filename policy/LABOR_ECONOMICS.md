# LABOR ECONOMICS: Work in the Automation Age
## The Vocational Economy: From "Post-Work" to "Freedom to Work"
### By Zeno

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

If AI and robots can provide unlimited labor, what happens to human work? This document addresses the fundamental economic questions about labor in the automation age: how wages are determined, how professional standards are maintained, and what work means when it's chosen.

**VERSION 2.4 UPDATE (The Vocational Economy):** Earlier framings emphasized "post-work" or "freedom from work." Research and pilot programs revealed this framing was dangerously incomplete. Humans need purpose, not just security. The Vocational Economy reframes automation's impact:

- **Old Framing:** Automation frees humans FROM work → leisure society
- **New Framing:** Automation frees humans TO work → vocational society

**The Core Insight:** We're not eliminating work—we're clarifying what only humans can do. Automation absorbs "functional labor" (processing, optimizing, executing). This frees humans for "vocational labor"—the face-to-face economy of care, creativity, connection, and meaning that requires subjective experience (qualia).

## PART I: THE LABOR ECONOMICS CHALLENGE

### 1.1 Traditional Wage Theory

**Marginal Productivity Theory:**
- Wages equal the marginal product of labor
- Workers paid for what they produce
- Supply and demand determine equilibrium

**What Automation Changes:**
- Machine productivity becomes nearly unlimited
- Human marginal product falls in automatable tasks
- Supply/demand model breaks down for many jobs
- "Market wages" could approach zero for replaced work

### 1.2 The Race to the Bottom Concern

**If Robots Do Everything:**
- Human labor becomes optional for employers
- Wage pressure downward for remaining jobs
- "Gig economy" dynamics intensify
- Workers compete for scarce positions

**Current Evidence:**
- Wage stagnation despite productivity growth (1970s-present)
- Gig economy growth (Uber, TaskRabbit, etc.)
- Declining labor share of GDP
- Increasing monopsony power

### 1.3 The Skills Polarization

**What's Happening:**
- High-skill, high-wage jobs growing
- Low-skill, low-wage jobs growing
- Middle-skill, middle-wage jobs shrinking
- "Hourglass" labor market

**What Automation Accelerates:**
- AI automates cognitive middle-skill work
- Robots automate physical middle-skill work
- Remaining work is very high or very low skill
- Inequality between workers increases

## PART II: THE HUMAN STANDARD APPROACH

### 2.1 Citizen's Royalty as Labor Market Foundation

**The Reservation Wage:**

Citizen's Royalty sets a floor below which no one must accept work.

- **Current:** Workers accept any wage above starvation
- **With Citizen's Royalty:** Workers accept work only if worth their time
- **Effect:** Wage floor rises for undesirable work

**Evidence from Pilots:**
- Alaska PFD: No significant labor force exit
- GiveDirectly: Recipients invest in businesses
- Stockton: Recipients worked MORE, not less
- Negative Income Tax: Modest work reduction, more education

**The Power Shift:**
- Worker can walk away from bad jobs
- Employer must offer reasonable terms
- Bargaining power equalizes
- Quality of work improves

### 2.2 Wage Determination in Citizen's Royalty Economy

**For Automatable Work:**

If a robot can do the job at $X/hour total cost:
- Human wage must be competitive OR
- Human brings something robot cannot
- Jobs where humans have no advantage: transition to robot
- Jobs where humans have advantage: human premium

**For Non-Automatable Work:**

Work requiring humanity (care, creativity, judgment, authenticity):
- Supply is limited (humans only)
- Demand may increase (as people value human touch)
- Wages determined by scarcity of human talent
- Potential for wage premium for "certified human"

**For Mixed Work:**

Human-AI collaboration:
- AI handles routine components
- Human handles exceptions, judgment, relationships
- Productivity increases
- Wages could rise or fall depending on supply/demand

### 2.3 The New Wage Equation

**Traditional:**
```
Wage = Marginal Product of Labor (in competitive market)
```

**In Automation Age:**
```
Wage = max(Reservation Wage + Premium, Robot Cost - Preference)
```

Where:
- Reservation Wage = Citizen's Royalty + value of leisure
- Premium = what employer pays above minimum
- Robot Cost = total cost of automation
- Preference = consumer preference for human

**Implications:**
- Citizen's Royalty raises all wages by raising reservation
- Automation cost sets ceiling for commodity work
- Human preference creates space above automation cost
- Premium paid for skill, reliability, humanity

## PART III: PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS IN A POST-SCARCITY WORLD

### 3.1 The Standards Question

**Concern:**
> "If work is optional, won't quality decline? Won't standards erode? Won't we lose craft and excellence?"

**The Counter-Evidence:**

**Amateur Excellence Exists:**
- Open source software (Linux, Apache) is world-class
- Wikipedia is comprehensive and often accurate
- Fan communities produce high-quality content
- Hobbies often produce museum-quality work

**Professionals Aren't Just Motivated by Money:**
- Artists, scientists, teachers often underpaid yet excellent
- Craftspeople take pride in work beyond payment
- Status, reputation, mastery are powerful motivators
- Intrinsic motivation often superior to extrinsic

### 3.2 Maintaining Professional Standards

**For Licensed Professions (Medicine, Law, Engineering):**

Licensing remains essential:
- Public safety requires competence verification
- Education and testing requirements unchanged
- Continuing education required
- Malpractice liability remains
- Citizen's Royalty doesn't change the stakes of professional work

**For Craft Professions (Trades, Arts, Skilled Work):**

Certification and reputation:
- Guild-like organizations for quality standards
- Certification programs for skill verification
- Reputation systems (reviews, portfolios)
- Competition among practitioners for clients

**For Knowledge Work:**

Output-based evaluation:
- Work product speaks for itself
- Collaboration and peer review
- Performance metrics where appropriate
- Market selection of quality

### 3.3 The New Motivation Framework

**Intrinsic Motivators:**
- Mastery: Getting better at something valuable
- Purpose: Contributing to something meaningful
- Autonomy: Control over one's work
- Connection: Relationships with colleagues and clients

**Extrinsic Motivators (Still Exist):**
- Income above Citizen's Royalty: Higher living standard
- Status: Recognition and respect
- Opportunity: Access to interesting work
- Legacy: Lasting contribution

**The Research:**
- Dan Pink's "Drive" on intrinsic motivation
- Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)
- Studies of open source contributors
- Research on creative professionals

**The Human Standard View:**
- Citizen's Royalty provides security, not luxury
- Motivation to excel remains strong
- Freed from survival pressure, quality may increase
- Passion-driven work often higher quality

## PART IV: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND OWNERSHIP

### 4.1 Should Ownership Change?

**The Question:**
> "If robots and AI create most value, should workers or society own the companies?"

**Options:**

1. **Status Quo (Shareholder Primacy)**
   - Investors own companies
   - Workers are employees
   - Automation benefits go to owners
   - Citizen's Royalty redistributes after the fact

2. **Worker Ownership (Cooperatives)**
   - Workers own companies
   - Democratic governance
   - Automation benefits shared among workers
   - Less relevant as work declines?

3. **Stakeholder Capitalism**
   - Multiple stakeholders considered
   - Community, workers, environment, shareholders
   - Modified fiduciary duty
   - Still private ownership

4. **Public Ownership**
   - State owns key industries
   - Automation benefits to all citizens
   - Democratic control
   - Historical problems with efficiency

5. **Mixed Model (Human Standard)**
   - Private ownership of production
   - Taxation captures automation value
   - Citizen's Royalty distributes benefits broadly
   - Some public ownership in key areas

### 4.2 The Human Standard Approach

**We Don't Mandate Ownership Changes:**

- Forced ownership change is coercive and politically difficult
- Market competition can include cooperatives
- Taxation achieves redistribution without ownership change
- Innovation incentives preserved

**We Encourage Alternative Models:**

- Tax benefits for employee ownership (ESOPs)
- Legal frameworks for cooperatives improved
- Worker representation on boards (codetermination)
- Profit-sharing requirements for large corporations

**We Ensure Broad Benefit:**

- Automation tax captures value at source
- Citizen's Royalty distributes to all citizens
- No single ownership form mandated
- Outcomes matter more than structure

### 4.3 Public Ownership Where Appropriate

**Natural Monopolies and Utilities:**
- Single provider most efficient
- Private monopoly problematic
- Public utility model appropriate
- AI governance for critical infrastructure

**Strategic Industries:**
- Diversified Strategic Reserve (public)
- AI governance infrastructure (public)
- Digital identity infrastructure (public)
- Not everything, but key commons

**The Hybrid:**
- Private production, taxed
- Public commons, shared
- Neither purely capitalist nor socialist
- Pragmatic based on what works

## PART V: THE TRANSITION PERIOD

### 5.1 Managing Workforce Transition

**Timeline of Displacement:**
- Near-term: Specific occupations affected
- Medium-term: Broad swaths of economy
- Long-term: Most routine work automatable

**Transition Support:**

| Need | Response |
|------|----------|
| Income during transition | Citizen's Royalty (immediate) |
| Retraining | Lifelong Learning Accounts |
| Job search | AI-enhanced matching |
| Geographic mobility | Moving assistance |
| Psychological support | Career counseling, mental health |

### 5.2 New Work Categories

**Work That Remains or Grows:**

| Category | Examples | Why Human |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Care | Nursing, therapy, teaching | Human connection essential |
| Creativity | Art, design, innovation | Authentic human expression |
| Leadership | Management, politics | Trust and accountability |
| Craft | Artisan goods, cuisine | Preference for human-made |
| Judgment | Ethics, strategy | Stakes too high for AI |
| Presence | Hospitality, entertainment | Human experience |

**New Work Created:**

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| AI oversight | Trainers, auditors, ethicists | Managing AI systems |
| Human verification | Certified human content/service | Premium on humanity |
| Experience design | Creating meaning-rich experiences | Leisure economy |
| Community building | Facilitators, organizers | Social infrastructure |
| Care at scale | New care models | Aging population |

### 5.3 The Role of "Bullshit Jobs"

**David Graeber's Observation:**
- Many jobs feel meaningless to workers
- Created for social/political reasons
- Productive technology should eliminate them
- Why do they persist?

**The Human Standard Response:**
- Don't create new bureaucracy
- Citizen's Royalty eliminates need for make-work
- Transition is to meaningful activity, not just new jobs
- Accept that paid employment may shrink
- Design society for flourishing beyond work

## PART VI: BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS

### 6.1 How Does Universal Citizen's Royalty Affect Behavior?

**Existing Evidence (Limited):**

- Pilot programs (Stockton, GiveDirectly, etc.)
- Lottery winners
- Inherited wealth recipients
- Countries with extensive social benefits

**Findings:**
- Labor force participation slightly down
- But: More education, more caregiving, more entrepreneurship
- Mental health improves
- Risk-taking increases (entrepreneurship)
- Short-term gains, long-term unclear

**What We Don't Know:**
- Universal permanent Citizen's Royalty (never tried)
- Cultural shifts over generations
- Effects of automation simultaneously
- International migration effects

### 6.2 Behavioral Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1: Work Continues (High Confidence)**
- Most people work for more than money
- Status, purpose, structure, social connection
- Alaska PFD shows no mass exit from work
- Citizen's Royalty amount is baseline, not luxury

**Hypothesis 2: Work Quality Improves (Medium Confidence)**
- Bad jobs harder to fill
- Employers must compete for workers
- Work conditions improve
- Productivity may increase per worker

**Hypothesis 3: Entrepreneurship Increases (Medium Confidence)**
- Risk-taking becomes affordable
- Side projects become startups
- Innovation distributed more broadly
- Failure less catastrophic

**Hypothesis 4: Care Work Increases (High Confidence)**
- Caregiving becomes financially viable
- Family care replaces institutional
- Community involvement increases
- Volunteer work expands

**Hypothesis 5: Some Problematic Behavior (Medium Confidence)**
- Some people may withdraw
- Substance abuse among vulnerable
- Gambling or poor decisions
- Social isolation for some

**Response to Hypothesis 5:**
- Mental health support essential
- Community structures important
- These problems exist now (often worse)
- Net benefit still likely positive

### 6.3 Designing for Good Outcomes

**Nudge Architecture:**
- Default enrollment in savings/investment
- Financial literacy education

## PART VII: THE MEANING OF WORK

### 7.1 Work Beyond Income

**What Work Provides:**
- Structure: Daily rhythm, goals, deadlines
- Status: Role in society, identity
- Social: Colleagues, community, belonging
- Purpose: Contribution, meaning
- Growth: Learning, mastery, challenge

**Without Paid Work:**
- These needs don't disappear
- Must be met through other means
- Society must provide alternatives
- Individual must find new paths

### 7.2 Sources of Meaning Beyond Employment

**Alternatives:**

| Need | Work Provided | Post-Work Options |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Structure | Job schedule | Personal projects, education, volunteering |
| Status | Job title | Reputation, achievement, community role |
| Social | Colleagues | Community, friends, family, interest groups |
| Purpose | Work output | Caregiving, civic engagement, creativity |
| Growth | Career advancement | Learning, hobbies, mastery pursuits |

### 7.3 The Human Standard Vision

**Not a World Without Work:**
- Work as choice, not compulsion
- Work for meaning, not survival
- Work in service of human flourishing
- Freed from drudgery, focused on value

**A World with Better Work:**
- Less routine, more creative
- Less exploitative, more fair
- Less meaningless, more purposeful
- Less precarious, more secure

## CONCLUSION

**The Vocational Economy (VERSION 2.4):**

1. **Wages will be determined differently:** Citizen's Royalty sets floor, automation sets ceiling for functional work, **vocational premium** creates space for face-to-face labor.

2. **Standards will be maintained:** Licensing, certification, reputation, and intrinsic motivation preserve quality—especially in vocational work where presence and relationship matter.

3. **Ownership can remain private:** But taxation ensures benefits are shared broadly, funding the Citizen's Royalty that enables vocational choice.

4. **Transition requires support:** Income, retraining, mobility, and psychological support—plus **recognition that care work IS work**.

5. **Behavior will change:** But evidence suggests the change is toward meaning, not idleness. Humans seek purpose.

6. **Meaning will flourish:** Through the Vocational Economy of care, creativity, community, and connection.

**The Vocational Economy Insight:**

The danger of "post-work" framing was that it suggested humans no longer needed to contribute. This is psychologically false and sociologically dangerous. What automation eliminates is not the need for human work—it is the need for humans to do work that machines can do better.

What remains—and what expands massively—is vocational labor: the face-to-face economy that requires:
- **Qualia** (subjective experience)
- **Presence** (being with, not just serving)
- **Relationship** (reciprocal connection over time)
- **Meaning-making** (not just content generation)

**The Human Standard doesn't abolish work—it reveals what human work truly is.**
