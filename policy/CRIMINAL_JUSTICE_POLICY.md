# CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY
## Justice That Works

---

## Executive Summary

The United States incarcerates more people than any nation on Earth—nearly 2 million behind bars, 5% of the world's population but 25% of its prisoners. This is not making us safer. It's destroying families, wasting billions, and perpetuating cycles of poverty and crime.

**The Zeno Approach:** Evidence-based reform that reduces incarceration while improving public safety. Not soft on crime—smart on crime. Data shows states that cut prison populations saw greater crime reductions than those that expanded them.

**Core Principles:**
- **Incarceration for danger, not poverty** - End wealth-based detention
- **Treatment over punishment** - For addiction and mental health
- **Accountability with humanity** - Consequences that rehabilitate
- **Restore, don't just punish** - Repair harm to victims and communities
- **Second chances work** - Reentry support reduces recidivism
- **Technology with safeguards** - AI can help, but must be audited

## Part I: The Crisis of Mass Incarceration

### Current State (2025)

**The Numbers:**
- Total incarcerated: ~1.9 million people
- In local jails: 655,000 (450,000+ awaiting trial, legally innocent)
- Drug offenses: 360,000+ incarcerated
- Life sentences: 1 in 7 imprisoned people
- Youth incarceration: Rising for first time in 20+ years (11% increase 2021-2022)
- Annual cost: $182 billion (direct costs)

**Recent Trends:**
- Prison population grew ~2% since 2023 (reversing decade of declines)
- Still 13% below pre-pandemic levels
- Texas alone accounts for 31% of recent prison growth
- 10 states continue reducing populations despite national trend

**The Racial Disparity:**
- Black Americans: 5x more likely to be incarcerated than white Americans
- Hispanic Americans: 1.3x more likely
- These disparities persist even controlling for offense type

### What Actually Reduces Crime

**Evidence from Reform States:**

| State | Prison Reduction | Crime Result |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| New York | -50% (1999-2023) | Violent crime -34% (vs. -28% national) |
| New Jersey | -44% jail population | Homicides -32%, all categories fell |
| California | Significant reductions | No increase in violent crime |

**The Research:**
- States that reduced incarceration saw *greater* crime declines
- Youth incarceration fell 75% (2000-2022), youth crime also fell
- Violent crime is near historic lows despite reform
- What changed: Public *perception* of crime, not actual crime

---

## Part II: Ending Wealth-Based Detention

### The Cash Bail Crisis

**Current Reality:**
- 80%+ of jail inmates are legally innocent (awaiting trial)
- Annual cost of pretrial detention: $13.6 billion
- Average bail: $10,000 (unaffordable for most Americans)
- Result: Poor people sit in jail, wealthy go free for same charges

**The Evidence on Reform:**

| Jurisdiction | Reform Result |
|--------------|---------------|
| Illinois (first to eliminate cash bail) | Violent crime -12%, jail population -14%, 95% court appearance |
| Chicago (Cook County) | Homicides -16%, shootings -23%, 84% no new offense |
| New York City | Re-arrest rates *lower* after reform (57% vs 66%) |
| New Jersey | Violent offense re-arrest while awaiting trial: <1% |

**National Data:**
- 92% of people released without cash bail return to court
- No relationship found between bail reform and crime rates (33-city study)

### Policy Framework: The Pretrial Justice Act

**Pillar 1: End Cash Bail**
- Replace money bail with risk assessment
- Detention only for genuine flight risk or danger
- Presumption of release for non-violent offenses
- 48-hour hearing requirement for any detention

**Pillar 2: Pretrial Services**
- Court reminder systems (text, call, app)
- Transportation assistance to court
- Childcare support for court dates
- Employment protection for court appearances

**Pillar 3: Risk Assessment Reform**
- Transparent, validated risk tools
- Regular algorithmic audits for bias
- Human override requirement
- Prohibition on using zip code/employment as factors

**Pillar 4: Speedy Trial Enforcement**
- Maximum pretrial detention: 60 days (misdemeanor), 120 days (felony)
- Automatic release if deadline missed
- Prosecutorial accountability for delays

**Projected Impact:**
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Pretrial jail population | 450,000+ | <150,000 |
| Average pretrial detention | Months | Days |
| Court appearance rate | 75% | 95% |
| Annual savings | — | $9+ billion |

---

## Part III: Drug Policy Revolution

### The Failed War on Drugs

**Current State:**
- 360,000+ incarcerated for drug offenses
- Drug convictions define federal prison system
- Fentanyl crisis: 100,000+ overdose deaths annually
- Criminalization hasn't reduced drug use or addiction

**Lessons from Portugal:**
- Decriminalized all drugs in 2001
- Results: HIV infections halved, overdose deaths plummeted
- Drug users 45x less likely to die from overdose than U.S.
- Key: Decriminalization + robust treatment = success

**Lessons from Failed Experiments:**
- Oregon/British Columbia: Decriminalized without treatment infrastructure
- Result: Increased visible drug use, public backlash, policy reversal
- Lesson: Decriminalization alone fails; treatment capacity is essential

### Policy Framework: The Public Health Approach to Drugs

**Pillar 1: Decriminalization with Accountability**

| Substance | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Cannabis | Full legalization, regulated market |
| Psychedelics | Decriminalize possession, therapeutic use |
| Other drugs | Decriminalize personal use, mandatory diversion |

**Key Design Elements (Portugal Model):**
- Dissuasion commissions (doctors, social workers, lawyers)
- Mandatory evaluation for apprehended users
- Treatment referral, not jail
- Administrative penalties for repeated refusal of treatment
- NOT consequence-free: accountability without incarceration

**Pillar 2: Treatment Infrastructure**

| Investment | Annual Funding |
|------------|---------------|
| Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) expansion | $5 billion |
| Residential treatment beds | $3 billion |
| Outpatient treatment capacity | $2 billion |
| Recovery housing | $2 billion |
| Peer support specialists | $1 billion |
| **Total** | **$13 billion/year** |

**Capacity Targets:**
- Treatment on demand: <7 day wait time nationally
- MAT availability in every county
- Naloxone (Narcan) free and universally available
- Safe consumption sites in high-overdose areas

**Pillar 3: Fentanyl-Specific Response**
- Fentanyl test strip legalization nationwide
- Enhanced penalties for large-scale trafficking (not users)
- Border interdiction investment (but recognize limits)
- Demand reduction as primary strategy

**Pillar 4: Cannabis Justice**
- Federal legalization and regulation
- Expungement of prior cannabis convictions
- Equity licenses for communities harmed by prohibition
- Tax revenue to affected communities

**Projected Impact:**
| Metric | Current | 5-Year Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Drug overdose deaths | 100,000+/year | 50,000/year |
| Drug incarceration | 360,000 | 100,000 |
| Treatment wait time | Weeks-months | <7 days |
| Fentanyl seizures | — | Doubled |

## Part IV: Police Reform & Accountability

### The Challenge

Trust between police and communities—especially Black and brown communities—has eroded. Rebuilding it requires accountability, transparency, and reimagining public safety.

**Current Issues:**
- Use of force incidents undermine legitimacy
- Qualified immunity shields misconduct
- Police unions resist accountability
- Training emphasizes force over de-escalation
- Mental health calls handled by armed officers

### Policy Framework: The Police Accountability Act

**Pillar 1: Use of Force Standards**

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Force authorization | Only when necessary to prevent imminent harm |
| De-escalation | Required before force; documented |
| Duty to intervene | Officers must stop colleagues' misconduct |
| Chokeholds/neck restraints | Banned except when deadly force authorized |
| No-knock warrants | Banned except imminent threat of violence |
| Warning requirement | Verbal warning before deadly force when feasible |

**Pillar 2: Accountability Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Qualified immunity | Reform: Clear violation of rights = liability |
| Independent investigation | All deadly force reviewed by independent body |
| Civilian oversight | Mandatory civilian review boards with subpoena power |
| Decertification database | National registry of fired/decertified officers |
| Pattern/practice authority | DOJ authority to investigate departments |

**Pillar 3: Body Camera Requirements**

Based on research showing 11 of 19 studies found force reduction, 20 of 26 showed complaint reduction:

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Camera activation | Mandatory for all enforcement encounters |
| Viewing before reports | Prohibited for use-of-force incidents |
| Public release | Within 5 days for deadly force/serious injury |

| Community engagement | 8 hours annually |

**Pillar 5: Alternative Response**

| Call Type | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Mental health crisis | Mental health professional + officer backup |

| Substance abuse | Crisis intervention team |
| Noise complaints | Civilian responders |
| Traffic enforcement | Unarmed traffic agents |

**Investment:** $5 billion federal grants for alternative response programs

---

## Part V: Sentencing Reform

### The Problem of Excessive Sentences

**Current State:**
- 1 in 7 prisoners serving life sentences
- Mandatory minimums remove judicial discretion
- Sentence lengths increased even as crime fell
- No correlation between sentence length and deterrence

**Evidence:**
- Deterrence research: Certainty of punishment matters more than severity
- Long sentences don't reduce recidivism
- Incarceration after age 40 has minimal public safety benefit
- Each year of imprisonment costs taxpayers $40,000+

### Policy Framework: The Proportionate Sentencing Act

**Pillar 1: Mandatory Minimum Reform**

**Pillar 4: Prosecutorial Accountability**
- Charge stacking limitations
- Plea bargain transparency
- Discovery requirements
- Conviction integrity units mandatory

| **Total** | **$9 billion/year** |

**Projected Impact:**
| Metric | Current | 5-Year Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 5-year re-arrest rate | 76% | 50% |
| Post-release employment | 40% | 70% |
| Post-release homelessness | High | Rare |

## Part VIII: Restorative Justice

### Beyond Punishment

Traditional criminal justice asks: What law was broken? Who broke it? How should they be punished?

Restorative justice asks: Who was harmed? What do they need? Who is responsible for meeting those needs?

---

## Part X: AI & Technology in Criminal Justice

### The Promise and Peril

- 65,600+ letters from incarcerated people seeking help
- 99% of wrongful convictions involve male defendants
- 70% involve minorities (61% Black, 8% Latino)

**Contributing Factors:**
- Mistaken eyewitness identification (36% of Indiana wrongful convictions)
- Invalid/misapplied forensic science (50% of DNA exonerations)
- False confessions
- Informants who lied
- Government/prosecutor misconduct

**The Hidden Problem:**
- Estimated 2-10% of all convictions may be wrongful
- Many innocent people accept plea bargains
- DNA only applicable in small fraction of cases
- Most wrongful convictions never discovered

### Policy Framework: The Innocence Protection Act

---

## Part XII: Fines, Fees & Debt-Based Punishment

### The Criminalization of Poverty

**Current State:**
- 1 in 3 Americans owed court fines/fees in the past decade
- $27+ billion in outstanding fines and fees debt
- 11 million people with suspended licenses for unpaid fines
- 68% of people with court debt missed work for court dates
- 19% report court debt impacted employment

**The Debt Trap:**
1. Person receives fine they cannot pay
2. Late fees, interest added
3. Driver's license suspended
4. Person drives anyway (needs to work)
5. Arrested for driving on suspended license
6. More fines, possible incarceration
7. Cycle repeats

**Racial Disparities:**
- People of color more likely to experience poverty
- More likely to be stopped by police
- More likely to be ticketed for same violations

| Outstanding court debt | $27 billion | $10 billion | $5 billion |
| People jailed for inability to pay | Thousands | Hundreds | Zero |
| Public defender fee states | Many | Few | Zero |

---

## Part XIII: Prosecutorial Reform

### The Most Powerful Actor

Prosecutors have more power over criminal justice outcomes than any other actor—more than police, judges, or legislators. Yet they face little accountability.

**Current Issues:**

- Federal government: Executions resumed then paused
- Death row population: ~2,300 people
- 2024 executions: Lowest in three decades
- States with moratoriums: Growing

**The Problems:**
- Racial disparities: Death penalty more likely when victim is white
- Wrongful convictions: 190+ death row exonerations since 1973
- Geographic arbitrariness: Depends on county, not crime
- Ineffective deterrence: No evidence death penalty deters murder
- Cost: Death penalty cases cost 3-10x more than life imprisonment

### Policy Framework: The Death Penalty Reform Act

|--------|------|------|-----------|
| States with death penalty | 38 | 27 | <15 |
| Annual executions | 85 | <20 | 0 |
| Death row population | 3,600 | 2,300 | <500 |
| Exonerations | 85 total | 190+ total | None needed |

## Part XII: Integration with Zeno Framework

### Connection to Core Pillars

| Zeno Pillar | Criminal Justice Integration |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Economic Justice** | Citizen's Royalty reduces poverty-driven crime; employment programs |
| **AI Governance** | Algorithmic accountability in criminal justice AI |
| **Human Capital** | Education/job training in prisons; workforce reentry |
| **Truth Infrastructure** | Transparent crime data; body camera footage access |

### The Automation Connection

As automation displaces workers, crime could rise if economic distress increases. The Zeno approach addresses root causes:
- Citizen's Royalty provides economic floor
- Lifelong learning enables adaptation
- Mental health services address despair
- Criminal justice becomes last resort, not first response

## Conclusion: Justice That Heals

The American criminal justice system is broken—not because it's too soft, but because it doesn't work. We incarcerate more people than any nation while failing to keep communities safe or help victims heal.

**The Zeno vision:**
- Detention for danger, not poverty
- Treatment for addiction, not cages
- Accountability without cruelty
- Restoration over retribution
- Second chances that work
- Communities that are actually safer

This isn't about being soft on crime. It's about being smart. The evidence is clear: we can have less incarceration AND less crime. States that reformed have proven it.

The choice isn't between public safety and justice reform. The choice is between a system that perpetuates cycles of crime and poverty, and one that breaks them.
