# HOUSING POLICY
## Abundant Housing for All

---

## Executive Summary

America faces a housing crisis of historic proportions. Rents consume half of income for the poorest families. Homelessness hit record highs in 2024. Young people can't afford homes their parents bought at their age. And it's largely a self-inflicted wound: we've regulated ourselves into a housing shortage.

**The Zeno Approach:** Build more housing. Everywhere. For everyone. Remove the artificial barriers—zoning, permitting, NIMBYism—that prevent construction. Housing abundance, not scarcity, is the path to affordability.

**Core Principles:**
- **Supply is the solution** - You can't redistribute housing that doesn't exist
- **YIMBY everywhere** - Yes In My Backyard as national policy
- **Homes, not investments** - Housing is shelter first, asset second
- **Homelessness is solvable** - Housing First works
- **Markets + safety net** - Build freely, protect the vulnerable
- **Local control has limits** - When localities fail, states and feds must act

---

## Part I: The Housing Crisis

### The Affordability Catastrophe

**Current State (2025):**
- Only 37 affordable homes available per 100 extremely low-income renters
- 70% of lowest-wage households spend >50% of income on rent
- Median home price: 7x median income (historically: 3-4x)
- First-time homebuyers: Average age now 38 (was 29 in 1981)
- Rental vacancy rate: Near historic lows

**The Shortage:**
- Housing deficit: 3-7 million units (estimates vary)
- Annual construction needed: 1.5 million units
- Annual construction actual: ~1 million units
- Gap grows by 500,000 units every year

**Geographic Concentration:**
The crisis is worst where jobs are—coastal cities, tech hubs, major metros:

| Metro Area | Median Home Price | Income Needed |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| San Francisco | $1.3M+ | $350,000 |
| Los Angeles | $950K+ | $250,000 |
| New York | $750K+ | $200,000 |
| Boston | $750K+ | $200,000 |
| Seattle | $800K+ | $210,000 |

### Homelessness Emergency

**2024 Point-in-Time Count:**
- Total homeless: 771,840 (highest ever recorded)
- Unsheltered: 274,000+ (streets, cars, encampments)
- Children: Nearly 150,000
- Annual sheltered homeless: 1.4 million
- Chronic homeless: Nearly doubled since 2016

**Root Cause:**
Homelessness is primarily a housing problem. Mental illness and addiction are factors, but the strongest predictor is housing cost. Cities with expensive housing have more homelessness—period.

---

## Part II: Why We Have a Shortage

### Exclusionary Zoning

**The Problem:**
- 75% of residential land in major cities zoned for single-family only
- Apartments, townhomes, duplexes banned in most neighborhoods
- Minimum lot sizes mandate large, expensive homes
- Parking requirements add $50,000+ per unit in construction costs
- Height limits prevent efficient use of land

**The History:**
Zoning originated in the 1920s—often explicitly to exclude minorities and the poor. The racial covenants were struck down, but the exclusionary effect remains through "neutral" rules.

**The Result:**
- Housing can't be built where it's needed
- Artificial scarcity drives up prices
- Workers can't live near jobs
- Long commutes, sprawl, emissions
- Segregation by income persists

### The Permitting Nightmare

**Average time to approve housing:**
| Jurisdiction | Approval Timeline |
|--------------|-------------------|
| San Francisco | 3-5 years |
| Los Angeles | 2-4 years |
| New York | 2-3 years |
| Houston | 3-6 months |

**Costs of Delay:**
- Each year of delay adds 5-10% to project cost
- Small builders can't survive the process
- Only large developers with capital can play
- Reduces competition, increases prices

### Environmental Review Abuse

**CEQA (California) and Similar Laws:**
- Originally: Prevent environmental harm
- Now: Tool to block any development
- Single-family homeowners sue to stop apartments
- "Environmental review" weaponized against housing

**Cambridge, MA Example:**
- Before zoning reform: Expected 350 units in 15 years
- 2023: Only 5 units built
- Average rent: $3,375/month (69% above U.S. average)

---

## Part III: The YIMBY Agenda

### Build More Housing

The fundamental solution is simple: build more homes. The debate about what kind of housing, or who should build it, is secondary. We need millions more units.

### Policy Framework: The Yes In My Backyard Act (Federal)

**Pillar 1: Zoning Reform Requirements**

Federal housing funds (CDBG, HOME, etc.) conditioned on:

| Reform | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Single-family exclusivity | Must allow 2-4 units on all residential lots |
| Accessory dwelling units | Must allow by-right on all single-family lots |
| Transit-oriented density | Must allow 4+ stories within 1/2 mile of transit |
| Minimum lot sizes | Cannot exceed 5,000 sq ft |
| Parking minimums | Must eliminate near transit |

**Pillar 2: Permitting Reform**

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| By-right development | Projects meeting code approved administratively |
| Timeline limits | 90 days for compliant projects |
| Shot clock | If no decision in 90 days, project approved |
| Fee limits | Impact fees capped at actual infrastructure cost |
| One-stop permitting | Single application for all approvals |

**Pillar 3: Environmental Review Reform**
- NEPA categorical exclusions for housing in developed areas
- State environmental review limits for infill housing
- Standing requirements to prevent frivolous lawsuits
- Expedited review for affordable housing projects

**Pillar 4: Preemption of Local Obstruction**
- State override of local zoning for housing near transit
- State approval process if locality fails to permit
- Fair share housing requirements for all municipalities
- No jurisdiction can opt out of growth

### State-Level Models

**California (Despite Challenges):**
- SB 9: Allows duplexes on single-family lots statewide
- SB 35: Streamlined approval for compliant projects
- ADU reforms: Hundreds of thousands of new units
- SB 79 (2025): Enables more multifamily in LA

**Massachusetts:**
- MBTA Communities Act: Zoning for multifamily near transit required
- Chapter 40B: State can override local zoning for affordable housing

**Cambridge (2025 Reform):**
- Now allows 4-story apartments citywide
- Expected to unlock significant new construction
- Model for Harvard/MIT communities nationwide

---

## Part IV: Affordable Housing Production

### Beyond Market Rate

Markets alone won't serve the poorest. Subsidized affordable housing remains essential for those market-rate housing can't reach.

### Policy Framework: Affordable Housing Investment Act

**Pillar 1: Housing Trust Fund Expansion**

| Program | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| National Housing Trust Fund | $740 million | $5 billion |
| HOME Investment Partnerships | $1.3 billion | $5 billion |
| LIHTC (annual allocation) | $10 billion | $15 billion |
| Public housing capital | $3 billion | $10 billion |
| **Total** | ~$15 billion | **$35 billion** |

**Pillar 2: Social Housing Development**
- Federal social housing development corporation
- Mixed-income developments on public land
- Permanently affordable (deed-restricted, not time-limited)
- Resident governance models
- Vienna model adaptation for U.S. context

**Pillar 3: Community Land Trusts**
- Federal support for CLT development
- Land acquisition funding
- Technical assistance grants
- Permanent affordability through land ownership separation

**Pillar 4: Inclusionary Requirements**
- 10-20% affordable units in developments receiving federal support
- In-lieu fees must fully fund equivalent affordable units
- Long-term affordability requirements (50+ years)
- No warehousing of affordable units

**Production Targets:**

| Housing Type | Annual Production Target |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Market-rate multifamily | 800,000 units |
| Market-rate single-family | 400,000 units |
| LIHTC affordable | 150,000 units |
| Public/social housing | 100,000 units |
| ADUs and conversions | 200,000 units |
| **Total** | **1.65 million units** |

---

## Part V: Rent Policy

### The Rent Control Debate

**The Evidence (Mixed):**
- Rent control protects existing tenants short-term
- Reduces housing supply long-term (10% in restrictive markets)
- Can increase rents in uncontrolled units
- Design matters enormously

**But Also:**
- 32 prominent economists argued rent control doesn't limit supply
- Effects vary dramatically by design and context
- Tenant protections reduce displacement and homelessness
- Rapid rent increases destabilize communities

### The Zeno Position: Tenant Protection, Not Price Fixing

Rather than strict rent control, focus on:
1. Building abundant housing (primary affordability strategy)
2. Protecting tenants from predatory practices
3. Targeted assistance for vulnerable populations

### Policy Framework: Tenant Protection Act

**Pillar 1: Anti-Gouging Protections**
- Rent increase limits: 5% + inflation annually (not strict rent control)
- Just cause eviction required
- Relocation assistance for no-fault evictions
- Right to renew leases

**Pillar 2: Tenant Rights**
- Source of income discrimination banned
- Criminal history discrimination limited
- Security deposit limits (1 month maximum)
- Right to organize tenant associations

**Pillar 3: Rental Assistance Expansion**

| Program | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Housing Choice Vouchers | 2.3 million households | 5 million households |
| Emergency rental assistance | Variable | $5 billion permanent fund |
| Shallow subsidies | Limited | New program: 2 million households |

**Pillar 4: Eviction Prevention**
- Right to counsel in eviction proceedings
- Eviction diversion programs
- Mandatory mediation before filing
- Sealing of eviction records after 3 years

---

## Part VI: Homeownership Access

### The Homeownership Gap

**Current State:**
- White homeownership: 74%
- Black homeownership: 45%
- Hispanic homeownership: 51%
- Young adult homeownership: Declining for decades

**Barriers:**
- Down payment requirements
- Student debt
- Tight credit standards
- High prices relative to income
- Competition from investors

### Policy Framework: First-Time Homebuyer Act

**Pillar 1: Down Payment Assistance**

| Program | Design |
|---------|--------|
| First-time buyer grant | $25,000 (income-capped) |
| Matched savings program | 3:1 federal match up to $10,000 |
| Employer contribution | Tax-advantaged housing accounts |
| Family assistance | Gift tax exclusion expansion for home purchases |

**Pillar 2: Credit Access**
- FHA modernization: Updated for current market
- Special purpose credit programs for underserved groups
- Alternative credit scoring (rent payments, utilities)
- Closing cost assistance

**Pillar 3: Investor Competition Limits**
- Institutional investor disclosure requirements
- Tax disadvantages for bulk purchases of single-family homes
- First-look periods for owner-occupants
- Limits on short-term rental conversions in tight markets

**Pillar 4: Homeownership Sustainability**
- Pre-purchase counseling requirement
- Mortgage assistance for hardship
- Property tax circuit breakers
- Foreclosure prevention programs

---

## Part VII: Ending Homelessness

### Housing First Works

**The Evidence:**
- 80%+ still housed after one year with Housing First
- Charlotte, NC: $2.4 million saved in one year
- 1,050 fewer jail nights, 292 fewer hospital days per cohort
- Veteran homelessness: Down 47% (2010-2016) using Housing First

**Why Treatment First Fails:**
- Requires sobriety/compliance before housing
- Most people can't address addiction while homeless
- High dropout rates from treatment while on streets
- Housing stability enables recovery, not vice versa

### The 2025 Policy Conflict

HUD's new rules limit Housing First funding to 30% of grants, shifting toward "Treatment First." Twenty states and DC have sued to block this, arguing it violates federal law and evidence.

### Policy Framework: The Homelessness Elimination Act

**Pillar 1: Housing First as Federal Standard**
- Codify Housing First in law
- Require evidence-based approaches for federal funding
- Prevent administrative rollbacks
- Housing + services, but housing unconditional

**Pillar 2: Rapid Rehousing Expansion**

| Program | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Emergency Solutions Grants | $290 million | $2 billion |
| Continuum of Care | $3 billion | $10 billion |
| VASH (veterans) | 100,000 vouchers | 200,000 vouchers |
| Youth homelessness | $140 million | $1 billion |

**Pillar 3: Permanent Supportive Housing**
- 500,000 new PSH units over 10 years
- On-site services: Mental health, addiction, case management
- Low barrier: No sobriety or treatment requirements to enter
- Scattered site and project-based options

**Pillar 4: Prevention**
- Emergency rental assistance before eviction
- Diversion programs at shelter intake
- Discharge planning from institutions (jails, hospitals, foster care)
- Rapid response teams for newly homeless

**Pillar 5: Unsheltered Response**
- Sanctioned camping with services (transitional, not permanent)
- Safe parking programs
- Navigation centers
- Outreach teams connecting to housing
- No criminalization of homelessness

**Investment Required:**
Per the National Alliance to End Homelessness: $9.6 billion annually would provide permanent housing for every sheltered homeless household. Total cost to functionally end homelessness: ~$20 billion/year.

**Homelessness Targets:**

| Metric | 2024 | 2030 Target | 2040 Target |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Total homeless (PIT) | 771,840 | 300,000 | 100,000 |
| Unsheltered | 274,000 | 50,000 | Rare |
| Chronic homeless | 150,000+ | 25,000 | Functionally zero |
| Veteran homeless | 35,000 | 10,000 | Functionally zero |

---

## Part IX: Land Policy

### Land Value & Housing Affordability

Land costs often exceed construction costs in expensive markets. Policy should discourage land speculation and encourage productive use.

### Policy Framework: Land Value Policy

**Pillar 1: Land Value Taxation**
- Shift property taxes from buildings to land
- Discourages holding vacant land
- Encourages development/density
- Revenue-neutral transition over 10 years

**Pillar 2: Public Land for Housing**

- 1 million public housing units nationwide
- Average age of public housing: 50+ years
- Many developments uninhabitable without major renovation

**The Problem:**
- Congress chronically underfunds public housing capital
- PHAs can't access private capital under traditional public housing rules
- Properties deteriorate; units lost to demolition
- Waiting lists grow (years-long in many cities)

### Policy Framework: Public Housing Revitalization Act

**Pillar 1: RAD Expansion and Improvement**

- Not subject to public housing rules
- Revenue from higher-income units subsidizes affordable
- Vienna/Singapore models adapted for U.S.
- Resident governance and ownership pathways

**Modernization Targets:**

| Metric | Current | 2030 | 2040 |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| Units in good condition | 60% | 85% | 98% |
| Energy efficiency (avg) | Poor | Moderate | High |
| Waiting list (average) | 2+ years | 1 year | 6 months |
| Units lost to demolition (annual) | 10,000 | 5,000 | Net positive |

---

## Part XIV: Manufactured Housing Reform

### The Overlooked Affordable Housing

**Current State:**
- 8.4+ million manufactured housing units nationwide
- Largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing
- Average cost: $86.62/sq ft (vs. $165.94 for site-built)
- 1,500 sq ft home: $118,980 cheaper than site-built
- Growing 10%+ year-over-year production

**The Barriers:**
- Outdated HUD Code (not updated meaningfully in 30+ years until 2025)
- Local zoning excludes manufactured homes
- Financing disadvantages (chattel loans, higher rates)
- Land ownership issues (lot rent vulnerability)
- Stigma ("mobile home" perception)

### Policy Framework: Manufactured Housing Modernization Act

| Park preservation | Right of first refusal for residents when parks sold |
| Infrastructure investment | Water, sewer, road improvements in manufactured housing communities |

**Model: ROC USA**
- 300+ resident-owned manufactured housing communities
- 22,000+ households own their communities
- Below-market lot rents, community governance
- Zero community closures when resident-owned

**Production Targets:**

| Metric | Current | 2030 | 2040 |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| Annual production | 100,000 | 200,000 | 300,000 |
| Zoning parity (% of localities) | 20% | 60% | 90% |
| Resident-owned communities | 300 | 1,000 | 3,000 |
| Average financing rate gap (vs. site-built) | 1.5% | 0.5% | 0% |

## Part XII: Integration with Zeno Framework

### Connection to Core Pillars

| Zeno Pillar | Housing Integration |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Economic Justice** | Citizen's Royalty makes rent affordable; housing stability enables employment |
| **AI Governance** | AI for construction, permitting optimization |
| **Climate & Energy** | Green building standards; housing near transit |
| **Human Capital** | Stable housing enables education; school integration |
| **Blockchain** | Property records on blockchain; transparent ownership |

### The Automation Connection

As automation reshapes work, housing policy must adapt:
- More remote work = need for housing beyond job centers
- Citizen's Royalty reduces poverty = reduces homelessness
- Construction automation = more affordable building
- ADUs and flexible housing = multigenerational living

## Conclusion: Abundant Housing

The housing crisis is a policy choice. We chose to restrict building in the places people want to live. We can choose differently.

**The Zeno vision:**
- Housing abundant enough to be affordable
- Zoning that allows people to live near jobs
- Homelessness functionally ended
- Homeownership accessible to young families
- Protection for vulnerable tenants
- Communities that welcome growth

This isn't about destroying neighborhoods. It's about letting them evolve. The "neighborhood character" worth preserving is people—and people need places to live.

The evidence is clear: places that build housing have more affordable housing. Places that restrict building have crises. The choice is ours.
