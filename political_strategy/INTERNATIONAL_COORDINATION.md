# INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION: Global Strategy for the Automation Age
## How The Human Standard Addresses Cross-Border Challenges
### By Zeno

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Automation, AI, and capital flows respect no borders. The Human Standard's policies require international coordination to succeed—otherwise, capital flight, regulatory arbitrage, and competitive pressures undermine domestic implementation. This document provides the global strategy.

**The Core Insight:** Unilateralism is insufficient but not impossible. We can proceed alone with protective measures while building a coalition of the willing.

## PART I: WHY INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION MATTERS

### 1.1 The Global Challenge

**Automation Is Global:**
- Robots manufactured globally, deployed globally
- AI systems developed by multinational corporations
- Technology diffusion is rapid across borders
- No country can wall itself off

**Capital Is Mobile:**
- Corporations can relocate operations
- Investment flows to favorable jurisdictions
- Tax bases can erode through offshoring
- Regulatory arbitrage is standard practice

**Policy Spillovers:**
- One country's lax AI regulation affects others
- One country's automation tax creates competitive disadvantage
- One country's UBI attracts or repels migration
- Climate policy requires global action

### 1.2 The Coordination Dilemma

**The Race to the Bottom:**
- Countries compete for investment by lowering standards
- Tax competition erodes revenue bases
- Regulatory competition weakens protections
- Everyone loses in equilibrium

**The Collective Action Problem:**
- Each country benefits from others' high standards
- Each country tempted to defect for competitive advantage
- Without coordination, suboptimal outcomes for all
- Need mechanisms to enforce cooperation

### 1.3 The Opportunity

**First-Mover Advantage:**
- U.S. can set global standards
- Early frameworks become defaults
- Soft power through policy export
- Shape rules rather than follow them

**Coalition Building:**
- Like-minded democracies want similar outcomes
- Shared challenges create shared interest
- U.S. leadership can catalyze action
- Success breeds adoption

## PART II: DOMAIN-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### 2.1 Automation Tax Coordination

#### The Challenge

- Automation tax creates cost disadvantage if unilateral
- Companies can offshore automation-intensive operations
- Revenue projections depend on compliance
- Competitive pressure creates political opposition

#### The Strategy

**Phase 1: Unilateral Foundation (Years 1-2)**

Implement domestically with protective measures:

1. **Disclosure Requirements**
   - Require automation deployment reporting
   - Build data on global deployment
   - No tax yet, just information

2. **Border Adjustments**
   - Tax imports from non-participating countries
   - Adjustment based on automation intensity
   - Legal under WTO as environmental/labor adjustment
   - Creates incentive for other countries to participate

3. **Destination-Based Component**
   - Tax based on where products are consumed
   - If sold in U.S., subject to U.S. tax
   - Doesn't matter where produced
   - Cannot be avoided through offshoring

**Phase 2: Coalition Building (Years 2-4)**

Build alliance of willing countries:

| Priority Partners | Alignment | Approach |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| European Union | High (already considering) | Joint framework development |
| United Kingdom | High | Post-Brexit alignment |
| Canada | High | USMCA renegotiation |
| Australia | Medium | Quad partnership |
| Japan | Medium | Technology cooperation |
| South Korea | Medium | Tech industry dialogue |

**Coordination Mechanism:**
- OECD working group on automation taxation
- Bilateral automation tax treaties
- Mutual recognition of standards
- Shared enforcement information

**Phase 3: Expansion (Years 4-7)**

Expand coalition, pressure holdouts:

1. **Critical Mass**
   - When 50%+ of global GDP participates
   - Non-participants face significant border adjustments
   - Incentive to join becomes compelling

2. **Holdout Strategy**
   - Name-and-shame for tax havens
   - Targeted trade measures
   - Investment restrictions
   - Exclusion from technology cooperation

### 2.2 AI Governance Coordination

#### The Challenge

- AI development is globally distributed
- Open source spreads across borders
- Authoritarian uses of AI governance concerning
- Safety standards require global adoption

#### The Strategy

**The Values-Based Framework:**

| South Africa | Regional leader | Cooperation agreement |

**Tier 3: Strategic Competition (China, Russia)**

| Approach | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Compete | Demonstrate democratic AI governance works |
| Contain | Restrict AI technology exports to authoritarian uses |
| Dialogue | Arms control-style agreements on AI weapons |
| Monitor | Track AI developments and uses |

**AI Governance Treaty (Long-Term):**

Proposed: International AI Governance Agreement

**Core Provisions:**
1. Transparency requirements for government AI
2. Safety testing standards for high-risk AI

### 2.4 Climate Tax Coordination

#### The Challenge

- Carbon taxes create competitiveness concerns
- Carbon leakage (production moves to low-tax countries)
- Developing countries resist carbon pricing
- Need for border adjustments

#### The Strategy

**Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism:**

1. **Import Adjustments**
   - Tax imports from countries without equivalent carbon price
   - Based on embedded carbon content
   - Revenue to domestic climate fund
   - WTO-compliant structure

2. **Export Rebates**
   - Rebate carbon costs for exports
   - Maintain competitiveness
   - Encourage domestic production
   - Adjust as other countries adopt

3. **Coordination with EU**
   - EU already implementing CBAM
   - Mutual recognition of carbon pricing
   - Avoid adjustment on trade between participants
   - Joint pressure on non-participants

**Climate Finance:**
- Developed country contributions to developing countries
- Technology transfer agreements
- Just transition support
- Paris Agreement enhancement

## PART III: MIGRATION AND UBI

### 3.1 The Migration Challenge

**The Concern:**
- UBI creates incentive for migration to U.S.
- People want to move to highest-benefit countries
- Could strain system if not managed
- Political opposition from immigration skeptics

### 3.2 The Policy Response

**Eligibility Rules:**

1. **Citizenship Requirement**
   - UBI for citizens only (initial implementation)
   - No immediate benefit for immigrants
   - Avoids migration-for-benefits concern

2. **Earned Pathway**
   - Permanent residents eligible after 5 years
   - Work requirement during waiting period
   - Contributes to tax base before receiving
   - Consistent with existing immigration law

3. **Pro-Rata for Partial Years**
   - New citizens receive partial year benefits
   - Returning expats same treatment
   - Prevents gaming through timing

**Immigration Policy Integration:**

| Immigrant Category | UBI Eligibility | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Natural-born citizens | Immediate | Birthright |
| Naturalized citizens | Immediate | Earned citizenship |
| Permanent residents | After 5 years | Contribution period |
| Work visa holders | None | Temporary status |
| Students | None | Temporary status |
| Undocumented | None | No legal status |
| Refugees | After status determination + 3 years | Humanitarian, with integration |

### 3.3 International Coordination on Migration

**Labor Mobility Agreements:**
- With trusted partners (Canada, UK, Australia, EU)
- Portability of benefits
- Mutual recognition of contributions
- Prevents double coverage or gaps

**Refugee/Asylum:**
- Maintain humanitarian commitments
- UBI phase-in for refugees
- International burden sharing

## PART VI: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

### 6.1 What's Achievable

**High Likelihood:**
- Coalition of democratic nations on AI governance
- OECD framework on digital taxation
- Carbon border adjustments with EU
- Migration coordination with key partners
- Technology export controls on adversaries

**Medium Likelihood:**
- Global automation tax coordination (50%+ of GDP)
- Binding AI governance treaty
- Cryptocurrency regulatory harmonization
- Climate tax coordination beyond current commitments

**Low Likelihood:**
- Universal global adoption of Human Standard policies
- China joining democratic AI governance
- Elimination of all tax havens
- Fully open borders with UBI portability

### 6.2 Timeline

**Year 1-2:**
- Domestic implementation with border adjustments
- Initial coalition discussions
- G7/G20 agenda setting
- Bilateral agreements with key partners

**Year 3-5:**
- Coalition of 10+ countries
- OECD framework adoption
- EU coordination agreements
- AI Governance Forum established

**Year 5-10:**
- Majority of democratic GDP participating
- Binding agreements in place
- Non-cooperators facing significant pressure
- System largely functioning

**Year 10+:**
- Near-universal adoption among democracies
- Stable international framework
- Long-term treaty structures
- Continuous improvement

### 6.3 What If Coordination Fails?

**Fallback: Unilateral Implementation with Protection**

If international coordination proves impossible:

1. **Maximize Border Adjustments**
   - Apply to all non-cooperating countries
   - Accept some trade friction
   - Protect domestic industry

2. **Focus on Domestic Goals**
   - UBI still achievable domestically
   - AI governance for domestic systems
   - Sound money as national choice

3. **Lead by Example**
   - Demonstrate success attracts imitators
   - Soft power through policy outcomes
   - Long-term influence

4. **Accept Limitations**
   - Global coordination may take decades
   - U.S. can thrive without it
   - Better outcomes still possible domestically

---

## CONCLUSION

**International Coordination Is:**
- Essential for maximum effectiveness
- Achievable among democratic allies
- Not a prerequisite for starting
- A long-term project requiring patience

**The Strategy:**

1. **Start at home:** Implement with protective measures
2. **Build coalition:** Like-minded democracies first
3. **Expand gradually:** Bring in developing countries
4. **Pressure holdouts:** Economic and diplomatic tools
5. **Accept imperfection:** Don't let perfect be enemy of good

**The Realistic Path:**

We can proceed with Human Standard policies without waiting for the world. But we pursue international coordination throughout because:
- It makes our policies more effective
- It prevents a race to the bottom
- It builds global norms for the automation age
- It creates a better world for everyone
