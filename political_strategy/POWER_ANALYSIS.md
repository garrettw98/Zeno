# POWER ANALYSIS: Understanding and Overcoming Opposition
## A Realistic Assessment of Who Opposes Human Standard Policies and Why
### By Zeno

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Transformative policies face opposition. That opposition isn't random—it follows predictable patterns based on interests, ideology, and institutions. This document maps the power landscape, identifies who will fight The Human Standard, analyzes their resources and strategies, and provides a plan for overcoming them.

**The Core Insight:** We cannot wish opposition away. We must understand it, divide it, neutralize it, and ultimately defeat it.

> **VERSION 2.0 UPDATE - COALITION ALIGNMENT**: This document has been updated to improve political coalition-building. Key changes: (1) "UBI" rebranded as **"Citizen's Royalty"** - framed as a return on public data/infrastructure investment, not welfare; (2) Updated libertarian messaging to emphasize property rights over data; (3) Refined cross-partisan appeal focusing on shared anti-corruption, anti-monopoly values.

## PART I: THE INTEREST LANDSCAPE

### 1.1 Who Benefits from the Status Quo?

**Class Analysis:**

| Class | Approximate Size | Current Advantage | Threat from Human Standard |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Billionaires | ~750 Americans | Wealth concentration | Wealth tax, automation tax |
| Centimillionaires ($100M+) | ~10,000 | Capital income advantage | Capital gains reform |
| Decamillionaires ($10M+) | ~200,000 | Investment returns | Tax increases |
| Millionaires ($1M+) | ~22 million | Asset appreciation | Higher consumption tax |
| Upper-middle class | ~30 million | Professional advantages | Some tax increases |
| Middle class | ~100 million | Relative stability | Net beneficiaries |
| Working class | ~80 million | Wages, benefits | Major beneficiaries |
| Poor | ~40 million | Few advantages | Major beneficiaries |

**The Math:** Roughly 250,000 households (0.2%) have most to lose. 220+ million (67%+) gain. But the 0.2% control disproportionate political power.

### 1.2 Industry-Specific Interests

**Industries That Oppose:**

| Industry | Annual Revenue | Lobbying Spending | Specific Concern |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|

| Fossil Fuels | $500 billion | $150M+ | Carbon tax |
| Pharmaceuticals | $600 billion | $100M+ | Healthcare reform |
| Real Estate | $400 billion | $80M+ | Land value tax, housing reform |
| Defense | $900 billion | $120M+ | Spending reallocation |

**Total Lobbying Against:** $750M+ annually from industries with direct stakes

**Industries That Might Support:**

| Industry | Reason for Potential Support |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Small Business | Citizen's Royalty creates consumer demand, payroll tax reduction |
| Retail | UBI creates spending power |
| Entertainment | More leisure time, spending capacity |
| Education/Training | Lifelong learning investment |
| Healthcare (some) | Universal coverage expands market |
| Renewable Energy | Carbon tax, infrastructure investment |

### 1.3 Institutional Opposition

**Established Institutions:**

| Institution | Interest | Approach |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Chamber of Commerce | Low taxes, deregulation | Oppose taxation, governance |
| Business Roundtable | Corporate interests | Mixed (some AI concerns) |
| Heritage Foundation | Conservative ideology | Oppose UBI, taxation |
| Cato Institute | Libertarian ideology | Mixed (like Citizen's Royalty concept, oppose taxes) |
| FreedomWorks | Anti-tax activism | Oppose taxation |
| National Association of Manufacturers | Manufacturing costs | Oppose automation tax |

## PART IV: COUNTER-STRATEGIES

### 4.1 Divide the Opposition

**Not All Opponents Are Equal:**

**True Ideological Opponents:**
- Committed to laissez-faire capitalism
- Will never support
- Cannot be persuaded
- Must be defeated

**Pragmatic Business Opponents:**
- Oppose specific provisions
- May trade opposition for benefits
- Can be negotiated with
- Look for win-win

**Reluctant Opponents:**
- Default to status quo
- Persuadable with evidence
- Fear change more than oppose goals
- Need reassurance

**Strategy: Peel off latter two categories, isolate true opponents**

**Fracture Lines:**

| Division | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Tech vs. Finance | Tech may prefer AI governance legitimacy |
| Small vs. Big Business | Small business benefits from UBI demand |
| Domestic vs. Multinational | Domestic firms gain from border adjustments |
| Old Economy vs. New Economy | New economy more automation-dependent |
| Shareholders vs. Management | Shareholders may want ESG alignment |
| Young vs. Old Wealth | Younger wealthy more aligned with change |

### 4.2 Build Countervailing Power

### 4.4 Reframe the Debate (VERSION 2.0)

**From "Welfare" to "Property Rights" (KEY LIBERTARIAN REFRAME):**

The Citizen's Royalty is NOT welfare. It is a **property rights dividend**:
- Your data has value - companies extract $1,000+/year from each citizen's data
- Public infrastructure (roads, internet, GPS, courts) enables corporate profits
- The Citizen's Royalty is your RETURN on these public investments
- It's not a handout - it's what you're OWED

**Frame for Libertarians:**
> "You own your data. Companies have been stealing it. The Citizen's Royalty is reparations for data theft and your dividend from the public infrastructure that makes their profits possible."

**From "Redistribution" to "Modernization":**
- Not taking from rich, but updating system for AI age
- Not welfare, but dividend on national wealth
- Not regulation, but accountability

**From "Cost" to "Investment":**
- Citizen's Royalty creates consumer demand, boosts economy
- AI governance prevents catastrophic failures
- Infrastructure investment returns multiples

**From "Radical" to "Inevitable":**
- Automation is coming regardless
- Choice is managed or unmanaged transition
- Every other developed country moving this direction
- U.S. will fall behind without action

**From "Government" to "People":**
- AI governance is people controlling their tools
- Citizen's Royalty is people sharing national prosperity
- Sovereign Humanity Fund is citizens as shareholders
