# POLICY SEQUENCING: The Order of Operations
## How Human Standard Policies Interact and Must Be Ordered
### By Zeno

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Policies don't exist in isolation. The order in which Human Standard policies are implemented determines whether they succeed or fail. This document maps the dependencies between policies and provides the optimal sequencing strategy.

**The Core Insight:** Some policies are prerequisites for others. Some policies can undermine each other if sequenced incorrectly. Getting the order right is as important as getting the policies right.

## PART I: DEPENDENCY MAPPING

### 1.1 Policy Dependency Matrix

```
LEGEND:
→ = Must come before
⟷ = Should be simultaneous
✕ = Conflicts if wrong order
```

| Policy | Prerequisites | Conflicts Without | Enables |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Citizen's Royalty | Tax infrastructure, Payment systems | Housing (inflation), Healthcare | Consumer demand, Risk-taking |
| Automation Tax | Disclosure framework, International coordination | Capital flight if no coordination | Citizen's Royalty funding |
| AI Governance | NAICO establishment, Standards development | Open source if security not ready | Trust, Adoption |
| Housing Reform | Political capital, State adoption | Citizen's Royalty (inflation without supply) | Citizen's Royalty effectiveness |
| Healthcare | Political capital, Funding | Citizen's Royalty (incomplete without it) | Worker mobility |
| Sound Money | Reserve establishment, Infrastructure | Citizen's Royalty if volatility not addressed | Long-term stability |
| Data Tax | Platform regulation, Measurement systems | Revenue if evasion not addressed | Citizen's Royalty funding |
| Carbon Tax | Economic modeling, Border adjustments | Competitiveness if unilateral | Climate, Citizen's Royalty funding |

### 1.2 Critical Dependencies

#### Citizen's Royalty Requires Housing Reform First (Or Simultaneously)

**The Problem:**
- Citizen's Royalty puts $24,000/year into every adult's pocket
- Without housing supply increase, landlords capture much of this
- Rents rise to absorb new income
- Real benefit to recipients diminishes

**Evidence:**
- Studies of cash transfer programs show rent increases
- Section 8 voucher research shows landlord capture
- Alaska Permanent Fund has seen housing inflation correlation

**The Solution:**
- Pass housing/zoning reform BEFORE or WITH Citizen's Royalty expansion
- Phase Citizen's Royalty in gradually to allow supply response
- Target housing supply increase in Citizen's Royalty ramp-up areas
- Include rent stabilization transition measures

**Sequencing:**
1. Housing reform legislation (Year 1)
2. Zoning changes take effect (Year 2)
3. Construction ramp-up (Years 2-4)
4. Citizen's Royalty expansion aligned with housing supply (Years 3-5)

#### Automation Tax Requires International Coordination

**The Problem:**
- Unilateral automation tax creates competitive disadvantage
- Companies can offshore automation
- Revenue projections become unreliable
- Political argument against policy strengthens

**Evidence:**
- Corporate inversions showed capital mobility
- State tax competition demonstrates race to bottom
- Carbon tax debate shows competitiveness concerns

**The Solution:**
- Begin international coordination before full tax implementation
- Use border adjustments for non-cooperating countries
- Build coalition of willing countries first
- Phase in domestically while building international framework

**Sequencing:**
1. Disclosure requirements (Year 1) - data gathering, no tax
2. International negotiations (Years 1-3)
3. Initial low tax rate (Year 3) - with border adjustments
4. Coalition adoption (Years 3-5)
5. Full tax rate (Year 5+) - with broad coalition

#### AI Governance Requires Security Framework First

**The Problem:**
- Transparency requirements without security hardening creates vulnerabilities
- Adversaries could exploit published code
- Trust in government AI undermined by breaches
- Political backlash against transparency

**The Solution:**
- Establish security standards before transparency requirements
- Phase transparency by system criticality
- Build security infrastructure in parallel
- Demonstrate secure open source success stories

**Sequencing:**
1. Security framework establishment (Year 1)
2. Tier 1 systems open sourced (Year 2)
3. Security hardening for Tier 2 (Years 2-3)
4. Delayed disclosure for Tier 2 begins (Year 3)
5. Full framework operational (Year 4)

## CONCLUSION

**Sequencing Matters:**

The Human Standard's success depends on getting the order right:

1. **Foundation first:** Build infrastructure before expansion
2. **Prerequisites before dependents:** Housing before Citizen's Royalty, security before transparency
3. **International coordination before full taxation:** Prevent capital flight
4. **Monitoring throughout:** Adjust based on real-world feedback
5. **Contingency plans ready:** Adapt to unexpected developments

**The Optimal Path:**

**Phase 0:** Preparation (pre-office)
**Phase 1:** Foundation (Year 1) - NAICO, disclosure, pilots
**Phase 2:** Prerequisites (Year 2) - Housing, healthcare, international
**Phase 3:** Expansion (Years 3-4) - Taxes, Citizen's Royalty growth, governance
**Phase 4:** Full Implementation (Years 5-7) - Complete system
**Phase 5:** Consolidation (Years 8+) - Constitutional protection

**Flexibility Is Key:**

This sequence is a plan, not a prison. Real-world feedback will require adjustments. The key is understanding the dependencies so we know what we CAN'T skip and what we can adjust.
