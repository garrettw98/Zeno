# The Human Standard: Electoral Roadmap
## From Philosophy to Political Power

---

## Strategic Overview

The Human Standard cannot be implemented without political power. This roadmap outlines the path from philosophical movement to governing coalition, with specific milestones, target races, and strategic considerations.

### Theory of Change

**Phase 1: Ideas** → **Phase 2: Candidates** → **Phase 3: Caucus** → **Phase 4: Majority** → **Phase 5: Governance**

The Human Standard succeeds by:
1. Shifting the Overton window on automation, Citizen's Royalty, and AI governance
2. Electing candidates who champion these policies
3. Building a cross-partisan coalition large enough to govern
4. Implementing policies that demonstrate success
5. Making the Human Standard the new common sense

---

## Phase 4: Governing Coalition (Years 6-8)

### Objectives
- Achieve legislative majority capable of passing Human Standard agenda
- Pass federal legislation on core priorities
- Elect President committed to Human Standard
- Build durable governing coalition

### Pathway to Majority

The Human Standard needs effective control of Congress to pass major legislation. This requires:

**House of Representatives:**
- 218+ members supporting Human Standard priorities
- Can be coalition of: Human Standard caucus + allies
- Target: 50+ core Human Standard members + 170+ persuaded allies

**Senate:**
- 50+ Senators supporting priorities
- Likely requires some Republican support given chamber composition
- Target: 5-10 core Human Standard members + 40+ allies

### Coalition Mapping

The Human Standard coalition crosses traditional partisan lines:

**Core Support (Primary Base):**
- Progressive Democrats (economic populism)
- Moderate Democrats (tech-forward, practical)
- Rust Belt Democrats (worker displacement)
- Independent/third-party voters

**Persuadable Allies:**
- Libertarian-leaning Republicans (self-custody, no CBDC)
- Populist Republicans (anti-corporate, worker focus)
- Tech-sector Republicans (innovation framing)
- Rural Republicans (Citizen's Royalty helps rural more than cities)

**Coalition Math:**
A winning coalition could include:
- 180 Democrats (of ~210 total)
- 35-40 Republicans (of ~225 total)
- = 215-220 votes (majority)

This requires sustained bipartisan framing and specific outreach to crossover Republicans.

### Presidential Strategy

**Option A: Major Party Primary**

Run Human Standard champion in Democratic primary:
- Emphasize economic populism
- AI/automation as defining issue
- Cross-partisan appeal as general election strength
- Build on congressional caucus and state wins

**Option B: Platform Influence**

Push major party nominee to adopt Human Standard positions:
- Negotiate platform inclusion
- Secure key appointments
- Ensure legislative agenda reflects priorities
- Cabinet positions for Human Standard leaders

**Option C: Independent/Third Party**

If major parties resist:
- Independent candidacy with bipartisan appeal
- Targeted to electoral math (specific states)
- High risk, potentially high reward
- Requires extraordinary circumstances

**Recommended Path:** Option A or B depending on political dynamics.

### Legislative Priorities for First Congress

**Year 1:**
1. Automation Workforce Transition Act (studies, pilot programs)
2. AI Transparency in Government Act
3. Digital Asset Regulatory Framework
4. Citizen's Royalty Pilot Program Authorization

**Year 2:**
1. Universal Basic Income Act (full program)
2. Open Source AI Governance Act
3. Automation Productivity Tax Act
4. Strategic Reserve & Monetary Stability Act

### Metrics for Success (Years 6-8)
- 50+ House members in caucus
- 5-10 Senators endorsing platform
- Major legislation passed (at least pilot programs)
- Presidential candidate committed to Human Standard
- National poll recognition of Human Standard policies

---

## Phase 5: Implementation and Consolidation (Years 8-12)

### Objectives

- Build popular support through successful programs
- Make policies durable against future reversal
- Expand to state and local implementation

### Implementation Milestones

**Year 1 of Administration:**
- Executive orders on AI governance for federal systems
- Begin Diversified Strategic Reserve accumulation
- Establish Citizen's Royalty Administration within Treasury
- Launch enrollment for initial Citizen's Royalty phase
- Appoint Human Standard leaders to key positions

**Year 2:**

- Full AI governance framework operational
- International coordination on automation economy
- State adoption of model legislation accelerates

**Years 5-8:**
- Citizen's Royalty reaches full the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model)
- Economic effects visible and popular
- Opposition party forced to accept or expand programs
- Policies become "third rail" like Social Security

### Durability Strategy

Making policies stick against future reversal:

**Popular Lock-In:**
- Direct benefits create constituencies (260 million Citizen's Royalty recipients)
- Monthly payments become relied upon
- Interruption becomes politically impossible

**Structural Lock-In:**
- Trust fund with dedicated revenue
- Bipartisan administration board
- Phase-out would require affirmative action

**Constitutional Lock-In:**
- AI Rights Amendment proposal (long-term)
- State constitutional provisions
- Court precedents on program rights

**International Lock-In:**
- Trade agreements include automation provisions
- International coordination makes unilateral reversal costly

### Metrics for Success (Years 8-12)
- Full Citizen's Royalty operational (the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) to all adults)
- Poverty rate below 4%
- AI governance framework globally influential
- Opposition party accepts program legitimacy
- Second-term electoral victory securing mandate

## Contingency Planning

### If Initial Electoral Efforts Fail

**Diagnosis:**
- Were candidates strong enough?
- Was messaging effective?
- Did we target winnable races?
- Was opposition effective?

**Adjustments:**
- Increase candidate training and vetting
- Refine messaging based on voter feedback
- Shift to more winnable targets
- Build broader coalition before next attempt

### If Legislative Efforts Stall

**Partial Victory Path:**
- Accept incremental versions of policies
- State-level laboratory approach
- Executive action where possible
- Continue building coalition for next cycle

**Pivot Points:**
- Economic crisis makes Citizen's Royalty urgent
- Major AI harm incident changes AI governance debate
- Populist political realignment creates new coalition possibilities

### If Opposition Intensifies

**Defensive Strategy:**
- Clearly define what Human Standard is NOT
- Preempt mischaracterizations
- Highlight bipartisan support
- Use opposition attacks to raise profile

**Offensive Strategy:**
- Define opponents as protecting billionaires
- Highlight their lack of alternative plan
- Use their opposition to mobilize base

## Conclusion

The Human Standard is a generational project. The electoral roadmap spans multiple cycles because fundamental change requires sustained effort. Success is not guaranteed, but the alternative—allowing technological transformation to occur without democratic input—is unacceptable.

The path runs from ideas to candidates to caucus to majority to governance. Each phase builds on the last. Setbacks are inevitable; persistence is essential.

The future is being built now. The question is whether the people will have a say in what it looks like. The Human Standard ensures they will.
