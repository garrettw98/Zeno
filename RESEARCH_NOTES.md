## ROBOTICS DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Tesla Optimus

**Production Timeline:**
- 2025: ~5,000 units planned (pilot production line at Fremont factory confirmed)
- 2026: Targeting 50,000-100,000 units
- V3 unveiling expected Q1 2026

**Current Status:**
- Pilot line running at Tesla's Fremont Factory
- Units deployed internally for real-world testing (pick-and-place operations)
- Internal factory deployment scaling through end of 2025

**Economic Target:**
- Musk's vision: "less than $20,000" per unit at scale
- Dramatically cheaper than competitors' humanoids

**Challenges:**
- Rare earth magnet supply chain dependencies (China restrictions)
- Bank of America downgraded Tesla due to execution risks
