## About This Project

This repository contains the research, framework, and drafts for a politically-driven book examining the convergence of AI and robotics and its implications for work, economics, and governance.

Inspired by Andrew Yang's warnings about automation and universal basic income, this work aims to:

1. **Document the Current State** - Map the companies and technologies reshaping our economy
2. **Project the Near Future** - Analyze what's coming in the next 5 years
3. **Quantify the Impact** - Present data-driven job displacement projections
4. **Propose Solutions** - Offer a balanced policy framework (the yin and yang)
5. **Inspire Action** - Build a movement for proactive, humane automation policy

## Repository Contents

## Core Thesis

We stand at the precipice of the most profound economic transformation in human history. The question is no longer *if* automation will displace millions of workers, but *how quickly* and *whether we will be prepared*.

This book argues for proactive policy—not reactive crisis management—to ensure technological abundance benefits everyone.
