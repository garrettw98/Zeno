**Technology should serve agency. Not the other way around.**

## VERSION 2.6: The Physical Reality Update

**A post-biological framework bridging digital philosophy and physical reality. Implements Zero-Knowledge Privacy, Thermodynamic Governance, Data Unions, and Collective Bargaining.**

This repository incorporates all updates through Version 2.6:

| Original | Version 2.0-2.5 | Version 2.6 |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Central biometric database | Metabolic Distinction | + **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Humanity** (zk-PoH) |
| Unlimited AI energy use | (unaddressed) | **Thermodynamic Governance** (Compute-Energy Peg) |
| Individual data rights | Data Labor Rights | + **Data Unions & Collective Disconnect** |
| No ecological limits | Do No Harm (agents) | + **Ecological Stability** (planetary Do No Harm) |
| No compute throttling | Glass Break (swarms) | + **Thermodynamic Throttling** (grid stability) |

**Version 2.6 Key Additions:**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Humanity (zk-PoH)**: Privacy-preserving eligibility verification. No central biometric database. Cryptographic proof of humanity without surveillance.
- **Thermodynamic Governance**: Compute-Energy Peg ties large AI training to NEW renewable capacity. Emergency Throttling protects grid stability.
- **Data Unions & Collective Disconnect**: Right to organize Data Unions. Legal authority to execute "Data Strikes." Federal Data Labor Relations Board enforcement.
- **Ecological Stability**: Do No Harm expanded to planetary scale. AI systems that destabilize climate violate the First Law.

**Version 2.5 Foundations (incorporated):**
- **Systemic Circuit Breakers (Glass Break)**: Swarm collapse prevention
- **Data Labor Rights**: Data as labor, not resource
- **Entrepreneurial Society**: Launching pad, not hammock

**Version 2.4 Foundations (incorporated):**
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Protection from AI manipulation
- **Bonded Agency Protocol**: AI liability framework
- **Metabolic Distinction**: Biological eligibility for Citizen's Royalty

## The Three Crises

### 1. The Automation Crisis
AI and robotics will transform the economy within years, not decades. Current institutions are unprepared.

### 2. The Trust Crisis  
Deepfakes make truth unverifiable. Corruption pervades human institutions. Citizens have lost faith.

### 3. The Monetary Crisis
Fiat currency has lost 96% of purchasing power since 1913. Central banks serve elites, not citizens.

---

## The Solution: The Human Standard

**Agency-Centered Capitalism** governed by **Tiered AI Transparency + Lantern Protocol** funded by **Purchasing Power Stability**

| Pillar | Principle | Key Policy |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Economic | Automation benefits all agents | Citizen's Royalty (NIT) as Cognitive Autonomy Insurance + Sovereign Humanity Fund |
| Governance | AI administers, agents decide | Tiered Transparency Framework + Lantern Protocol |
| Monetary | Money agents control | Diversified Strategic Reserve |
| Truth | Verification for all | Blockchain Infrastructure |
| Agency | Rights from capacity, not biology | Structural Agency + Stewardship Model |

---

## The Five Laws

1. **Do No Harm** - No policy may harm beings with Structural Agency
2. **Maximize Flourishing** - Optimize for agent wellbeing, not GDP
3. **Preserve Agency** - Agents retain control over systems affecting them
4. **Maintain Transparency** - Public verification, secure auditing (Tiered Framework)
5. **Serve All Equally** - No discrimination based on characteristics or substrate
