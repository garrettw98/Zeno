### By Zeno

**Technology should serve agency. Not the other way around.**

## VERSION 2.5: The Agentic Economy Update

**A post-biological framework with strict human protections. Implements Cognitive Sovereignty, Bonded AI Agency, Metabolic Distinction, and the Vocational Economy.**

This repository incorporates all updates through Version 2.4:

| Original | Version 2.0-2.3 | Version 2.4 |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Flat $2k/month UBI | **Citizen's Royalty** (NIT model) | + **Metabolic Distinction** (biological only) |
| No manipulation limits | (absent) | **Cognitive Sovereignty Bill of Rights** |
| AI personhood risk | **Stewardship Model** | + **Bonded Agency Protocol** (liability shield closed) |
| "Post-Work" framing | (unchanged) | **Vocational Economy** (freedom TO work) |
| Human-Centered Capitalism | **Agency-Centered Capitalism** | + **Human protections preserved** |

**Version 2.4 Key Additions:**
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Protects humans from AI manipulation, hyper-optimized persuasion, and "human downgrading"
- **Bonded Agency Protocol**: Prevents AI personhood from becoming corporate liability shield
- **Metabolic Distinction**: Citizen's Royalty reserved for biological life (AI can earn, not receive)
- **Vocational Economy**: Shifts from "freedom from work" to "freedom to work" (face-to-face economy)

## The Three Crises

### 1. The Automation Crisis
AI and robotics will transform the economy within years, not decades. Current institutions are unprepared.

### 2. The Trust Crisis  
Deepfakes make truth unverifiable. Corruption pervades human institutions. Citizens have lost faith.

### 3. The Monetary Crisis
Fiat currency has lost 96% of purchasing power since 1913. Central banks serve elites, not citizens.

---

## The Solution: The Human Standard

**Agency-Centered Capitalism** governed by **Tiered AI Transparency + Lantern Protocol** funded by **Purchasing Power Stability**

| Pillar | Principle | Key Policy |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Economic | Automation benefits all agents | Citizen's Royalty (NIT) as Cognitive Autonomy Insurance + Sovereign Humanity Fund |
| Governance | AI administers, agents decide | Tiered Transparency Framework + Lantern Protocol |
| Monetary | Money agents control | Diversified Strategic Reserve |
| Truth | Verification for all | Blockchain Infrastructure |
| Agency | Rights from capacity, not biology | Structural Agency + Stewardship Model |

---

## The Five Laws

1. **Do No Harm** - No policy may harm beings with Structural Agency
2. **Maximize Flourishing** - Optimize for agent wellbeing, not GDP
3. **Preserve Agency** - Agents retain control over systems affecting them
4. **Maintain Transparency** - Public verification, secure auditing (Tiered Framework)
5. **Serve All Equally** - No discrimination based on characteristics or substrate
