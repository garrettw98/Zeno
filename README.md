# THE HUMAN STANDARD
## A Political Worldview for the Age of Intelligent Machines
### By Zeno

---

> *Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around.*

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains **The Human Standard**—a complete political philosophy, policy framework, and strategic vision for governance in the automation age. Created by **Zeno**.

This is not just a book. This is:
- A comprehensive political worldview
- Detailed policy frameworks ready for legislation
- The foundation for books, campaigns, social media, and movements
- A blueprint for human-centered governance in the 21st century

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Three Crises

We face three converging crises that demand revolutionary response:

1. **The Automation Crisis**
   - AI and robotics will displace hundreds of millions of jobs
   - The timeline is compressed—years, not decades
   - Current institutions are unprepared

2. **The Trust Crisis**
   - Deepfakes make truth unverifiable
   - Corruption pervades human institutions
   - Citizens have lost faith in government

3. **The Monetary Crisis**
   - Fiat currency debases savings through inflation
   - Central banks serve elites, not citizens
   - The dollar's 96% purchasing power decline since 1913

### The Solution: The Human Standard

**Human-Centered Capitalism** governed by **Open Source AI** funded by **Sound Money**.

| Pillar | Principle |
|--------|-----------|
| **Economic** | Automation should benefit all, not just capital owners |
| **Governance** | AI can administer without corruption; humans set policy |
| **Monetary** | Citizens deserve money that cannot be debased |
| **Truth** | Blockchain provides verification in a post-truth world |
| **Global** | Shared challenges require coordinated solutions |

## The Five Laws

All Human Standard policies are constrained by five inviolable principles:

1. **Do No Harm** - No policy may directly cause physical harm or deprive basic necessities
2. **Maximize Flourishing** - Optimize for human wellbeing, not GDP or corporate profit
3. **Preserve Agency** - Humans retain ultimate control; override always possible
4. **Maintain Transparency** - All systems publicly auditable; no black boxes
5. **Serve All Equally** - No discrimination; no special treatment for wealthy or connected

---

## Human-Centered Metrics

Traditional metrics (GDP, stock market, unemployment rate) are rejected as primary measures.

**The Human Standard optimizes for:**

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Health | Life expectancy, mental health, childhood health, preventable deaths |
| Economic Security | Median income, poverty rate, housing affordability, debt levels |
| Freedom | Civil liberties, democratic participation, mobility, entrepreneurship |
| Environment | Air/water quality, biodiversity, sustainability, climate resilience |
| Social Cohesion | Trust, community engagement, family stability, safety |
| Opportunity | Educational attainment, income mobility, innovation |

---

## Political Positioning

The Human Standard transcends traditional left-right divisions:

| Issue | Human Standard Position | Traditional Left | Traditional Right |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| UBI | Yes (fund via automation) | Sometimes | Rarely |
| Open Borders for Capital | Taxed (Data Tax, Robot Tax) | Tax | Free flow |
| Cryptocurrency | Yes (sound money) | Skeptical | Mixed |
| AI Regulation | Open source mandate | Heavy regulation | Light touch |
| Government Size | AI-administered (smaller human bureaucracy) | Larger | Smaller |
| Global Governance | Federated coordination | International institutions | National sovereignty |

**The Coalition:**
- Libertarians: Sound money, reduced bureaucracy, individual freedom
- Progressives: UBI, worker protection, anti-corruption
- Populists: Anti-elite, anti-big-tech exploitation, citizen empowerment
- Technologists: AI governance, blockchain infrastructure, open source
