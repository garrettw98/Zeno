# The Human Standard: Movement Building Guide
## From Philosophy to Political Power Through Organizing

---

## Introduction

Ideas alone don't change the world. Movements do. This guide provides the framework for building a durable political movement capable of implementing The Human Standard.

### The Movement Building Formula

**Ideas** + **Organization** + **Constituencies** + **Strategy** + **Resources** + **Persistence** = **Change**

Each element is necessary. None is sufficient alone.

## Conclusion

Building a movement to implement The Human Standard is a generational project. It requires:

- **Clear vision** that inspires and mobilizes
- **Strong organization** that can execute
- **Diverse coalition** that reflects the broad appeal
- **Electoral power** that forces politicians to respond
- **Sustained resources** that enable long-term work
- **Persistent effort** that outlasts setbacks

The goal is not just to win arguments but to build power. Power to pass laws. Power to elect champions. Power to change the rules of the economy.

The automation economy is coming whether we organize or not. The question is whether the people will have a say in what it looks like. Through organizing, we ensure they will.
