## Introduction

You've read the philosophy. You've seen the evidence. You understand the stakes.

Now what?

Movements are built by individuals taking action. This document provides concrete steps—not vague inspiration, but specific things you can do today, this week, this month, and beyond.

The Human Standard will succeed or fail based on what people like you do next.

## Part I: Today (Next 30 Minutes)

### 1. Share This Repository

**Action:** Send the link to three people who might care.

Not everyone. Three people who:
- Worry about automation and AI
- Are frustrated with the economic system
- Think about the future their kids will inherit
- Are politically engaged but unsatisfied with current options

**Message template:**
> "I found something worth reading. It's a complete framework for making sure AI benefits everyone, not just tech billionaires. Called The Human Standard. Covers automation, Citizen's Royalty, government reform, everything. [LINK] What do you think?"

**Why it matters:** Ideas spread person to person. Three people who share to three more becomes thousands.

### 2. Follow and Subscribe

**Action:** Follow The Human Standard on whatever platforms exist. Subscribe to updates.

*[Note: As the movement builds, add specific links here]*

**Why it matters:** Algorithms reward engagement. Followers create visibility. Subscribers create community.

### 3. Save the Messaging Guide

**Action:** Bookmark or download MESSAGING.md. Screenshot the Quick Reference Card.

**Why it matters:** When conversations happen—and they will—you'll be ready.

---

## Part II: This Week

### 4. Have One Conversation

**Action:** Talk to someone about The Human Standard. In person. Not online.

Pick someone:
- A coworker worried about AI
- A family member frustrated with the economy
- A friend interested in politics
- Anyone willing to listen

Use the 2-minute pitch from MESSAGING.md. Then listen. Their objections will teach you what resonates and what needs work.

**Why it matters:** Every movement is built on conversations. You're practicing for thousands more.

### 5. Write Something

**Action:** Post your thoughts about The Human Standard. Your words, your platform.

Options:
- Twitter/X thread
- LinkedIn article
- Facebook post
- Blog post
- Reddit comment
- Substack article

You don't need to explain everything. Pick one aspect that resonates:
- The automation dividend concept
- The evidence from Citizen's Royalty pilots
- The sound money argument
- The deepfake/trust crisis
- Your personal story of why this matters

**Why it matters:** Your network is different from everyone else's. Your voice reaches people others can't.

### 6. Identify Your Skills

**Action:** Ask yourself: what can I contribute?

Check all that apply:
- [ ] **Writing** — Articles, editing, translation
- [ ] **Design** — Graphics, video, visual identity
- [ ] **Technology** — Web development, apps, data analysis
- [ ] **Research** — Academic background, fact-checking, source-finding
- [ ] **Organizing** — Event planning, community building, logistics
- [ ] **Speaking** — Comfortable presenting, podcasting, public forums
- [ ] **Money** — Able to donate or fundraise
- [ ] **Network** — Connected to influencers, journalists, politicians
- [ ] **Expertise** — Deep knowledge in economics, policy, AI, blockchain

Note what you can offer. When the movement organizes, these skills will be needed.

## Part III: This Month

### 7. Deep Dive on One Policy Area

**Action:** Read one policy document thoroughly. Become conversant in that area.

Pick based on your interests:
- `ECONOMIC_POLICY.md` — Robot Tax, Citizen's Royalty, Data Dividend
- `AI_GOVERNANCE.md` — Algorithmic government, transparency
- `BLOCKCHAIN_POLICY.md` — Sound money, truth infrastructure
- `HUMAN_CAPITAL_POLICY.md` — Healthcare, education, care
- `CLIMATE_ENERGY_POLICY.md` — Energy transition, carbon pricing
- `CRIMINAL_JUSTICE_POLICY.md` — Reform, drug policy
- `HOUSING_POLICY.md` — YIMBY, homelessness
- `IMMIGRATION_POLICY.md` — Reform, legalization
- `DEFENSE_FOREIGN_POLICY.md` — AI military ethics, alliances

**Why it matters:** Generalists spread the vision. Specialists win the arguments.

### 8. Find Local Allies

**Action:** Identify people in your area who might align with The Human Standard.

Look for:
- Local tech meetups (AI, blockchain communities)
- Economic justice organizations
- Libertarian groups (sound money interest)
- Progressive groups (Citizen's Royalty interest)
- Futurist/transhumanist communities
- Civic technology organizations

You don't need to recruit them yet. Just map who exists.

**Why it matters:** When local chapters form, you'll know who to invite.

### 9. Contact One Elected Official

**Action:** Write to your representative about automation policy.

You're not asking them to endorse The Human Standard (yet). You're:
- Putting automation on their radar
- Asking what their position is on AI displacement
- Introducing the concept of automation taxation
- Requesting they study Citizen's Royalty pilot results

**Template:**
> Dear [Representative],
>
> As your constituent, I'm concerned about the economic impact of AI and automation on our community. Studies suggest millions of jobs may be displaced in the coming decade.
>
> I'd like to know: What is your position on automation policy? Have you considered proposals like automation taxation or guaranteed income pilots?
>
> I believe this will be the defining economic issue of our time and would appreciate your attention to it.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your name and address]

**Why it matters:** Politicians respond to constituent interest. Enough letters create agenda items.

### 10. Prepare Your Finances

**Action:** Begin positioning for the transition personally.

Consider:
- **Emergency fund:** 3-6 months expenses (if not already)
- **Sound money exposure:** Learn about Bitcoin/crypto (not financial advice—just literacy)
- **Skill assessment:** What skills do you have that AI can't easily replace?
- **Debt reduction:** Less debt = more freedom in transition
- **Community investment:** Relationships are the ultimate safety net

**Why it matters:** You can't help others if you're drowning. Prepare yourself first.

- Write a letter to your local newspaper

- Companies announcing layoffs citing automation
- Citizen's Royalty or cash transfer programs in your area/region

- Journalists covering business/technology
- Union leaders

## Part V: Ongoing Commitments

### 15. Stay Informed

### 16. Consistent Communication

**Commit to:** Regular sharing about The Human Standard.

**Why it matters:** Consistency builds presence. Sporadic engagement fades away.

### 17. Financial Support

**Commit to:** Donating what you can when the movement establishes financial infrastructure.

Even small amounts matter:
- $5/month = $60/year
- 1,000 people at $5/month = $60,000/year
- 10,000 people at $5/month = $600,000/year

Movements need resources. Money or time—ideally both.

### 18. Personal Development

**Commit to:** Building your own capacity to contribute.

Consider:
- Public speaking skills (Toastmasters, etc.)
- Writing practice
- Understanding of policy/economics
- Technical skills relevant to the movement

## Part X: What Not to Do

### Don't Wait for Permission

The movement is open source. You don't need anyone's approval to act. If you see something that needs doing, do it.

### Don't Get Lost in Theory

Understanding the philosophy matters. But don't let perfect understanding delay imperfect action. You know enough to start.

### Don't Burn Out

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Sustainable commitment beats intense short bursts. Pace yourself.

### Don't Attack Potential Allies

Someone who agrees with 60% of The Human Standard is not your enemy. Build bridges. Find common ground. The coalition wins.

### Don't Be a Jerk Online

Every interaction represents the movement. Be firm but respectful. Persuade, don't humiliate. Win arguments by being right, not by being clever.

### Don't Neglect Your Life

The movement needs you healthy, employed, and connected. Don't sacrifice relationships, job, or health for activism. Balance sustains.

## Conclusion: The Choice

Every morning you wake up, you have a choice:

You can go about your day, hope things work out, trust someone else to fix the big problems.

Or you can take one action—small or large—that moves us toward a future where technology serves humanity.

The Human Standard doesn't need heroes. It needs thousands of ordinary people making ordinary efforts, consistently, over time.

The actions in this document are not complicated. Share a link. Have a conversation. Write a paragraph. Attend a meeting. Send an email.

None of them alone changes the world. All of them together do.

The automation transformation is coming. The question is whether we're ready with answers when people start asking questions.

That readiness is built by you, doing something, today.

What will you do?
