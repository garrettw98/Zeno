# HOUSING POLICY
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- Housing costs consume 30-50% of income for many Americans
- Median home price is 7x median income (historically 3-4x)
- 580,000+ Americans are homeless on any given night
- Restrictive zoning creates artificial scarcity

### THE SOLUTION
**Build more housing. House everyone. Tax land, not buildings.**

Three-pronged approach:
1. YIMBY zoning reform (allow building)
2. Housing First (end homelessness)
3. Land Value Tax (discourage speculation)

### YIMBY ZONING REFORM

**End artificial scarcity:**
- Allow duplexes/triplexes in single-family zones
- Permit accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by right
- Reduce parking minimums
- Streamline permitting (90-day approval)
- Transit-oriented development

**Federal incentives:**
- Infrastructure funding tied to zoning reform
- Priority for housing-friendly jurisdictions
- Technical assistance for local governments

### HOUSING FIRST

**End homelessness through housing:**
- Permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless
- Rapid rehousing for newly homeless
- Prevention programs (rent assistance, legal aid)
- No preconditions (sobriety, employment)

**Evidence:**
- Finland reduced homelessness 35% with Housing First
- Utah reduced chronic homelessness 91%
- Cheaper than emergency services, jails, hospitals

### LAND VALUE TAX

**Tax the land, not the building:**
- Encourages development (building not penalized)
- Discourages speculation (holding empty land costs money)
- Cannot be passed to renters (land supply is fixed)
- Revenue for affordable housing and Citizen's Royalty

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Renters** - More supply means lower prices
- **First-time buyers** - Homeownership becomes attainable
- **Homeless** - Permanent housing, not shelters
- **Existing homeowners** - Stronger communities, stable values

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"More housing will change neighborhood character"**
Neighborhoods change anyway. The question is whether change serves residents or speculators.

**"Housing First enables drug use"**
Evidence shows housing stability reduces substance abuse. Denying housing makes problems worse.

**"Land taxes will hurt homeowners"**
Exemptions for primary residences. Improves land with buildings taxed less. Most homeowners benefit.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
Housing is a human need, not a speculation vehicle. Build enough for everyone.
