# SOUND MONEY
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- The dollar has lost 96% of purchasing power since 1913
- Inflation is a hidden tax on savers and workers
- Central banks can print money at will, debasing your savings
- Citizens have no control over the currency that governs their lives

### THE SOLUTION
**Give Americans a sound money option**

Key policies:
- Diversified Strategic Reserve (national savings in sound money)
- Stablecoin framework (regulated digital dollars)
- No central bank digital currency (CBDC) surveillance
- Financial privacy protections

### STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE

**Why Bitcoin:**
- Fixed supply (21 million, ever)
- Cannot be inflated by governments
- Decentralized (no single point of failure)
- Already legal tender in El Salvador

**Implementation:**
- Acquire 1 million BTC over 10 years
- Multi-signature custody (military-grade security)
- No selling for 20 years
- Transparent, auditable holdings

### STABLECOIN FRAMEWORK

**Regulated digital dollars:**
- 1:1 backed by reserves
- Regular audits required
- Consumer protections
- Innovation-friendly licensing

**Why it matters:**
- Faster, cheaper payments
- Financial inclusion
- Competition for banks
- Dollar strength abroad

### NO CBDC SURVEILLANCE

**We oppose:**
- Programmable restrictions on spending
- Government tracking of all transactions
- Expiring money that forces spending
- Social credit systems

**We support:**
- Privacy in financial transactions
- Individual control of money
- Decentralized options

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Savers** - Wealth protected from inflation
- **Workers** - Wages not debased
- **Retirees** - Fixed income maintains value
- **Entrepreneurs** - Access to new financial tools

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"Bitcoin is too volatile"**
For reserve, long-term holding matters. For daily use, stablecoins provide stability.

**"Crypto enables crime"**
Cash enables more crime. Blockchain is traceable. Criminals prefer dollars.

**"We need government control of money"**
We are not eliminating dollars. We are adding options and ending the monopoly.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
You should control your money. Not the government. Not the banks. You.
