# CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- 2.3 million Americans incarcerated (highest rate in the world)
- Recidivism rate: 76% rearrested within 5 years
- Racial disparities: Black Americans incarcerated at 5x the rate of white Americans
- Private prison incentives conflict with public safety
- Poverty drives crime; prison creates poverty

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Economic security prevents crime. Human-centered justice promotes rehabilitation.**

### Three-Part Approach:

1. **Prevention Through Citizen's Royalty**: Eliminate poverty-driven crime at the source
2. **Proportional Justice**: Sentences matched to actual harm, not politics
3. **Rehabilitation Focus**: Prepare people to return as productive citizens

---

## KEY POLICIES

### Prevention
- Universal Basic Income eliminates desperation crimes
- Mental health and addiction treatment on demand
- Housing First to end homelessness-to-prison pipeline

### Sentencing Reform
- End mandatory minimums
- Eliminate cash bail (pretrial detention only for danger)
- Decriminalize poverty (fines scaled to income)

### Prison Reform
- Ban private prisons and immigration detention centers
- Education and job training in all facilities
- Voting rights restored upon release

### Reentry Support
- Citizen's Royalty available immediately upon release
- Ban the box on employment applications
- Expungement for non-violent offenses

## THE ECONOMIC CASE

| Current Cost | Proposed Investment | Net Savings |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| $80B/year on incarceration | $20B on prevention | $40B+ annually |
| $50K/year per prisoner | $24K/year Citizen's Royalty | Reduces crime at source |

**Every dollar in prevention saves $4-7 in incarceration costs.**

---

## WHO BENEFITS

- **Families**: Parents stay home, children avoid foster care
- **Communities**: Reduced crime, increased economic activity
- **Taxpayers**: Lower costs, better outcomes
- **Employers**: Larger workforce, reduced liability
- **Everyone**: Safer society through prevention, not punishment

---

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"This is soft on crime"**
Actually, it's smart on crime. Current system has 76% recidivism. Rehabilitation works better.

**"Criminals deserve punishment"**
They receive consequences. But punishment without rehabilitation just creates more crime.

**"Citizen's Royalty will increase crime"**
Studies show opposite: financial security reduces crime. Desperation drives most property crime.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

The best criminal justice system is one we rarely need. By ensuring economic security for all, we prevent most crime before it happens. For those who do offend, proportional consequences and genuine rehabilitation serve justice better than warehousing people in cages.
