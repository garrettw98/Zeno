# UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- Automation is eliminating jobs faster than new ones are created
- 40% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency
- Current safety net is complex, stigmatizing, and inadequate
- Workers have no leverage when survival depends on any job

### THE SOLUTION
**the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) to every American adult, no strings attached.**

### HOW IT WORKS
- Monthly direct deposit to every citizen 18+
- No means testing, no work requirements
- Stacks with Social Security and disability benefits
- Replaces some existing programs (SNAP, TANF, SSI)

### HOW WE PAY FOR IT

| Source | Revenue |
|--------|---------|
| Automation Tax (15% on robot productivity) | $200-400B |
| Data Tax (7.5% on ad revenue from user data) | $50-100B |
| Carbon Tax ($100/ton) | $200-400B |
| VAT (10-15% with exemptions) | $1.5-2T |
| Land Value Tax (2%) | $500B-1T |
| Program consolidation | $800B-1.2T |

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Everyone** receives the payment
- **Low/middle income** gain the most (net positive after taxes)
- **Caregivers** finally compensated for essential work
- **Entrepreneurs** can take risks without losing everything
- **Workers** can say no to bad jobs

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"People will stop working"**
Evidence from pilots shows most people continue working. Alaska has paid dividends for 40 years with no work reduction.

**"It's too expensive"**
We spend $1 trillion on existing programs. We lose $600B annually to tax evasion. We can afford what we prioritize.

**"It will cause inflation"**
Phased implementation + housing reform + monetary coordination prevents inflation spiral.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
Citizen's Royalty is not charity. It is your dividend on the wealth created by automation, data, and the commons we all share.
