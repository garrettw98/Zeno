# HEALTHCARE AND HUMAN CAPITAL
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- 27 million Americans uninsured
- Medical debt is leading cause of bankruptcy
- Healthcare costs: 18% of GDP (double peer nations)
- Employer-based insurance traps workers in jobs
- Mental health crisis accelerating

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Universal coverage. Preventive focus. Human development.**

### The Human Standard Healthcare Approach:

1. **Universal Coverage**: Everyone covered, period
2. **Cost Control**: Administrative simplification, negotiated prices
3. **Prevention First**: Investment in health, not just sick care
4. **Human Capital**: Education, training, lifetime development

---

## HEALTHCARE POLICIES

### Universal Coverage Options
We support pathways to universal coverage:
- Medicare expansion (public option or Medicare for All)
- Regulated private market with subsidies
- State-level experimentation

**Key requirement**: No one uninsured, no one bankrupted.

### Cost Control
- Administrative simplification (one set of rules)
- Drug price negotiation (like every other country)
- Transparency in pricing
- Ending surprise billing

### Mental Health
- Parity with physical health (enforced)
- On-demand access to therapy
- Integration with primary care
- Address social determinants (housing, income, community)

### Citizen's Royalty Integration
- Citizen's Royalty replaces some healthcare subsidies
- Frees healthcare from employment
- Reduces stress-related illness
- Enables preventive care

---

## HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT

Healthcare is part of broader human development:

### Education
- Universal pre-K (evidence-based investment)
- K-12 funding equalization
- Free community college
- Subsidized higher education
- Lifelong learning accounts

### Workforce Development
- Portable benefits (not tied to employer)
- Retraining for automation transition
- Credential recognition
- Apprenticeship expansion

### Child Development
- Paid family leave (6 months minimum)
- Child allowance (or child supplement to Citizen's Royalty)
- Early intervention for developmental delays
- Nutrition programs

## THE ECONOMIC CASE

**Current system wastes money:**
- $1 trillion/year in administrative costs
- $300 billion in untreated mental health costs
- Sick workers are unproductive workers
- Medical debt destroys economic mobility

**Investment returns:**
- Every $1 in early childhood education returns $7-12
- Preventive care costs less than emergency care
- Healthy workers are productive workers
- Reduced inequality increases growth

---

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"We cant afford universal healthcare"**
We already pay more than any country. Universal coverage REDUCES costs through simplification.

**"Government healthcare is inefficient"**
Medicare administrative costs: 2%. Private insurance: 15-20%. Government is more efficient here.

**"This is socialism"**
Every developed country has universal coverage. Markets can still exist within universal systems.

**"Wait times will increase"**
Countries with universal systems have similar or better wait times for most services.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

A healthy population is a productive population. Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege tied to employment. Investment in human development pays returns for generations. The Human Standard treats health and education as infrastructure, not luxury.
