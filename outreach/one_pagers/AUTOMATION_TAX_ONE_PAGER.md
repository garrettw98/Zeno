# AUTOMATION TAX
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- When a human earns $50,000, they pay income tax, payroll tax, state tax
- When a robot generates $50,000 in value, it pays nothing
- This creates a perverse incentive to replace humans with machines
- As automation grows, the tax base collapses while need grows

### THE SOLUTION
**Tax automation productivity, reduce taxes on human labor**

The Automation Productivity Tax (APT):
- Tax the value generated by automation above industry baseline
- Use revenue to fund Citizen's Royalty and transition support
- Offset with payroll tax reductions (revenue neutral for businesses)

### HOW IT WORKS

**Measure productivity gains:**
- Industry baseline: 10 widgets per worker-hour (example)
- Your company: 30 widgets per worker-hour
- Excess (automation): 20 widgets per worker-hour
- Tax the labor-equivalent value of excess productivity

**Phased implementation:**
- Years 1-2: Disclosure only (no tax)
- Years 3-4: 5% APT + 5% payroll tax cut
- Years 5-6: 10% APT + 7.5% payroll tax cut
- Year 7+: 15% APT + 10% payroll tax cut

### REVENUE USE
- 40% to Universal Basic Income fund
- 30% to Displaced Worker Transition Fund
- 20% to Lifelong Learning Accounts
- 10% to Social Security stabilization

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Workers** - Human labor becomes relatively cheaper
- **Small businesses** - Exempted from reporting in early phases
- **Society** - Automation benefits shared broadly
- **Companies** - Clear rules, revenue neutral overall

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"It will slow innovation"**
The tax is revenue neutral. Companies do not pay more overall - they pay differently. No penalty for automation.

**"You cannot define a robot"**
We tax productivity gains, not robots. Economic output is measurable. No need to count machines.

**"Companies will leave"**
Border adjustments tax imports from non-participating countries. Selling to Americans means paying American taxes.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
Robots should pay taxes too. Not because automation is bad - but because its benefits should be shared.
