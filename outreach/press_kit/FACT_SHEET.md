## UBI COSTS AND FUNDING

### Basic Math
- US adult population: ~258 million
- the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) = $24,000/year per adult

|--------|---------|------------|
| Value-Added Tax (10-15%) | $1.5-2.5T | High |
| Automation Tax (15%) | $200-600B | Medium |
| Carbon Fee ($100/ton) | $200-400B | High |
| Land Value Tax (2%) | $500B-1T | Medium |
| Existing Program Consolidation | $1-1.5T | Medium |
| Tax Recapture | ~$1T | Medium |

**Net new revenue needed: $3-4 trillion**

### Precedents

- US: ~5 billion metric tons CO2/year
- Per capita: ~15 tons (2x global average)
- Energy sector: 25% of emissions
- Transportation: 29% of emissions

### Carbon Pricing
- Current: No national carbon price
- Proposed: Starting $30/ton, rising to $100+
- Revenue potential: $200-400B annually at $100/ton
- Dividend per adult: ~$800-1,600/year
