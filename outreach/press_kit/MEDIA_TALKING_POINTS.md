## THE 30-SECOND PITCH

"Automation is coming whether we prepare for it or not. The Human Standard is a comprehensive framework for ensuring that as technology transforms the economy, the benefits flow to everyone - not just those who own the machines. We propose Citizen's Royalty, transparent AI governance, and a modernized tax system that captures productivity gains and shares them universally. Our core principle is simple: technology should serve humanity, not the other way around."

## CORE MESSAGES (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. **Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.**
2. **Prepare for automation now, or react to crisis later.**
3. **Citizen's Royalty is not paying people not to work - its ensuring everyone can negotiate from security.**
4. **Open source AI isnt about slowing progress - its about keeping humans in control.**
5. **This isnt left or right - its forward.**

## BY TOPIC

### Citizen's Royalty (Income Floor)

**Opening**: "Every American adult would receive the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model), no strings attached."

**Key points**:
- Consolidates and replaces fragmented welfare programs
- Funded by the Sovereign Humanity Fund and consumption, not labor
- Pilots show people continue working but with more choice
- Simpler and more dignified than means-testing

**Anticipated questions and responses**:

*"Why give money to rich people?"*
"Universal programs are simpler, cheaper to administer, and politically durable. The wealthy pay far more in taxes than they receive. Net effect is highly progressive."

*"Wont people stop working?"*
"Every Citizen's Royalty pilot shows this fear is overblown. People with security work differently - more selectively, more meaningfully - but they work. Retirement doesnt destroy the will to contribute."

*"How do you pay for it?"*
"$6 trillion sounds like a lot, but we already spend $4 trillion on federal benefits. We add automation taxes, VAT, carbon fees, and land value taxation. The math works."

---

### AI Governance

**Opening**: "If AI is going to make decisions that affect peoples lives, those systems need to be transparent and accountable."

**Key points**:
- Government AI should be open source (with security exceptions)
- Five Laws of Ethical AI: Do No Harm, Maximize Flourishing, Preserve Agency, Maintain Transparency, Serve All
- Human override for significant decisions
- Appeals process for AI-assisted decisions

**Anticipated questions and responses**:

*"Doesnt this slow down innovation?"*
"Transparency doesnt slow innovation - secrecy does. Open source accelerates development. Were not banning AI, were governing it."

*"What about security?"*
"We have a tiered system. Most government AI can be open. Security-sensitive systems have additional oversight. The default is transparency, not secrecy."

*"Isnt AI too complex to regulate?"*
"We regulate complex industries all the time - aviation, medicine, nuclear power. The alternative to governing AI is being governed by it."

---

### Automation Tax

**Opening**: "If a robot replaces a worker, the productivity gains should be shared, not hoarded."

**Key points**:
- 15% tax on productivity gains from automation
- Measures output relative to labor input
- Revenue-neutral design (offset by labor tax cuts)
- Captures value that otherwise accrues only to capital owners

**Anticipated questions and responses**:

*"Wont this discourage automation?"*
"No. Companies automate because its more profitable. A 15% tax on gains still leaves 85% of the benefit. And productivity gains flow back through Citizen's Royalty to consumers."

*"How do you measure automation?"*
"Same way we measure productivity now - output per worker hour. Its not perfect, but neither is any tax. We have detailed methodology."

*"Other countries dont do this"*
"Other countries are also scrambling to respond to automation. Someone has to lead. And our competitiveness is protected by the revenue-neutral design."

---

### Sound Money / Bitcoin

**Opening**: "Every reserve currency in history has eventually failed. Prudence requires hedging."

**Key points**:
- Strategic Bitcoin reserve (like strategic petroleum reserve)
- Maintains dollar primacy while hedging tail risks
- Protects savings from currency instability
- Not replacing dollar, adding to reserves

**Anticipated questions and responses**:

*"Bitcoin is too volatile"*
"For daily transactions, yes. As a store of value over decades, it has outperformed every other asset class. We propose reserve, not replacement."

*"This is crypto-bro nonsense"*
"Major institutional investors and several countries now hold Bitcoin. Its no longer fringe. Our proposal is conservative - a hedge, not a bet."

*"What about energy use?"*
"Valid concern. Mining is increasingly renewable. And energy use for sound money is a feature, not a bug - its what makes it hard to counterfeit."

## BRIDGING TECHNIQUES

When asked about unrelated topics:

- "Thats an important question, and it connects to our core concern..."
- "The Human Standard approach would be to ask..."
- "What were really focused on is..."
- "I think the deeper issue is..."

---

## HANDLING HOSTILE QUESTIONS

**"This is socialism"**
"We preserve markets, private property, and entrepreneurship. Were proposing redistribution through taxation, which is as American as Social Security."

**"Youre just giving people free money"**
"Its not free - its funded by taxes. Its a dividend on our collective investment in technology and infrastructure."

**"Who are you to propose this?"**
"The ideas stand on their own merits. Were presenting analysis and arguments. Evaluate them, not us."

**"This will never pass"**
"Maybe not today. But the conditions that make it necessary are accelerating. We want the ideas ready when the moment comes."

## CLOSING STATEMENTS

- "Prepare now, or react to crisis later. We choose preparation."
- "Technology will transform the economy. The only question is whether we shape that transformation or let it happen to us."
- "Visit thehumanstandard.org to read the full framework and join the conversation."
