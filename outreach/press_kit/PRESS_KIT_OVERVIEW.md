## ABOUT THE HUMAN STANDARD

The Human Standard is a comprehensive political philosophy for the automation age. As artificial intelligence and robotics transform the economy, we need new policies to ensure technology serves humanity rather than replaces it.

### Core Message
**"Technology Should Serve Humanity, Not the Other Way Around."**

### Author
Written under the pen name **Zeno**, invoking the Stoic tradition of ethical reasoning applied to political economy.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Is this left-wing or right-wing?**
A: Neither. The Human Standard draws from multiple traditions: the libertarian emphasis on freedom and markets, the progressive commitment to equality and public goods, and the conservative respect for stability and community.

**Q: How do you pay for Citizen's Royalty?**
A: Through a diversified tax base: automation productivity tax, value-added tax, carbon fee and dividend, land value tax, and existing program consolidation. Total new revenue needed: $3-4 trillion annually.

**Q: Wont Citizen's Royalty cause inflation?**
A: Not significantly. Its funded by taxes (not money printing), phased in gradually, and partially replaces existing transfers. Most inflation concerns apply to unfunded spending.

**Q: Why anonymous authorship?**
A: Ideas should be evaluated on their merits, not the identity of their author. Zeno represents a tradition of philosophical inquiry, not a personality.
