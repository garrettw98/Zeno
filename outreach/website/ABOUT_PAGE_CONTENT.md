## MAIN ABOUT PAGE

### Headline
About The Human Standard

### Introduction
The Human Standard is a comprehensive political philosophy for the automation age. As artificial intelligence and robotics transform the economy, we need policies that ensure technology serves human flourishing rather than displacing it.

This framework includes detailed proposals for Citizen's Royalty, AI governance, tax reform, sound money, housing policy, climate action, and much more. It is designed to be practical, achievable, and grounded in both evidence and enduring principles.

### Our Vision
We envision a future where:

- **Economic security is universal** - No one fears destitution in a world of abundance
- **Technology serves human purposes** - Machines work for us, not against us
- **Prosperity is shared** - The gains from automation benefit everyone
- **Democracy is preserved** - Humans control the systems that affect their lives
- **Flourishing is possible** - People can pursue meaningful lives beyond survival

### Our Approach
The Human Standard is neither left nor right. We draw from multiple traditions:

- From **conservatism**: Respect for markets, family, community, and stability
- From **liberalism**: Commitment to individual liberty and limited government
- From **social democracy**: Universal provision and public goods
- From **libertarianism**: Cash benefits over paternalism, skepticism of bureaucracy
- From **pragmatism**: What works matters more than ideology

The result is a synthesis that addresses the real challenges of the automation age while respecting the values that most people share.

### The Framework
The Human Standard includes:

- **The Manifesto** - Core principles and vision
- **Policy Documents** - Detailed proposals for major areas
- **Model Legislation** - Ready-to-adapt bills for legislators
- **Research Appendix** - Citations, methodology, confidence levels
- **Political Strategy** - How to build winning coalitions
- **Movement Building** - How to organize for change

All materials are available for free at TheHumanStandard.org.

## PHILOSOPHY PAGE (/about/philosophy)

The Philosophical Foundation

### The Core Principles

**Human Dignity**
Every human being possesses inherent worth that does not depend on their productivity, social status, or usefulness to others. This is not earned - it is recognized.

**Liberty**
People should be free to live their lives as they choose, so long as they do not harm others. Both freedom from coercion and freedom to pursue goals matter.

**Flourishing**
The goal of society is not merely survival but human flourishing - the full development of human capabilities and the living of a good life. We provide preconditions; people choose their paths.

**Justice**
Benefits and burdens of society should be distributed fairly, with special attention to the least advantaged. Not strict equality, but a floor beneath which no one falls.

### What We Believe

- **Technology is a tool** - Neither inherently good nor bad, but shaped by human choices
- **Markets are useful** - But not sufficient for all human needs
- **Government has a role** - But should be limited and accountable
- **Change is possible** - History is not predetermined; we shape it through collective action

### What We Reject

- **Technological determinism** - The idea that technology dictates social outcomes
- **Market fundamentalism** - The idea that markets solve all problems
- **State worship** - The idea that government can plan everything
- **Fatalism** - The idea that nothing can be done

## AUTHOR PAGE (/about/author)

### Headline
About Zeno

### Why a Pen Name?
The Human Standard is written under the pen name "Zeno," invoking the tradition of philosophical inquiry over personal identity.

The ideas in this framework should be evaluated on their merits - not on who wrote them, their credentials, or their background. The arguments stand or fall on their logic and evidence, not on authority.

### The Name
Zeno of Citium founded the Stoic school of philosophy in Athens around 300 BCE. The Stoics believed in:

- Living according to reason
- Focusing on what we can control
- Contributing to the common good
- Preparing for challenges before they arrive

These values inform The Human Standard. We apply reason to policy. We focus on actions we can take. We aim for the common good. We prepare for automation before the crisis hits.

### Engaging with the Work
We invite you to:

- **Read critically** - Question every claim
- **Check the sources** - We provide citations
- **Debate the ideas** - We welcome disagreement
- **Suggest improvements** - The framework evolves

The author is less important than the argument. Engage with the ideas.

## FAQ PREVIEW (for /about/faq)

### Most Common Questions

**Is this left-wing or right-wing?**
Neither. The Human Standard draws from multiple traditions and is designed to build cross-partisan coalitions. We focus on outcomes, not ideology.

**How do you pay for Citizen's Royalty?**
Through a diversified tax base: automation productivity tax, value-added tax, carbon fee and dividend, land value taxation, and consolidation of existing programs. The math is detailed in our policy documents.

**Will people stop working if they get Citizen's Royalty?**
Evidence from every pilot program shows that people continue to work. Citizen's Royalty separates work from survival, making work a choice - which actually makes work more meaningful.

**Why should AI be open source?**
Government AI systems that affect public decisions should be transparent and accountable. Open source enables auditing, prevents hidden bias, and maintains democratic oversight.

**Is this realistic?**
Every major policy change seemed unrealistic before it happened. Social Security, Medicare, civil rights - all required building movements and winning arguments. We are doing that work.
