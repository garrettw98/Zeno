## THE CHALLENGE

### Headline
The Old Rules No Longer Apply

### Body Copy
For generations, the social contract was simple: work hard, and you can build a decent life. But automation is rewriting the rules. AI systems now outperform humans on many cognitive tasks. Robots are entering warehouses, kitchens, and construction sites. Self-driving vehicles are beginning to replace human drivers.

This is not distant science fiction. It is happening now.

**47% of American jobs are at high risk of automation.** Yet our policies were designed for an economy that no longer exists. We need a new framework - one that ensures technology serves human flourishing rather than threatening it.

## THE FIVE LAWS

### Section Headline
The Five Laws of Ethical AI

1. **Do No Harm** - AI systems shall not take actions that harm humans
2. **Maximize Flourishing** - AI shall be designed to enhance human wellbeing
3. **Preserve Agency** - Humans retain meaningful choice in AI-affected decisions
4. **Maintain Transparency** - AI decision-making must be explainable
5. **Serve All Equally** - AI benefits must be distributed fairly

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### For Workers
Whether you drive trucks, analyze data, write code, or provide care - automation will affect your industry. The Human Standard ensures you have a foundation of security as the economy transforms.

### For Parents
What kind of economy will your children inherit? One where opportunity is restricted to the few who own the machines? Or one where everyone shares in the benefits of technological progress?

### For Business Leaders
The current trajectory is unsustainable. Automation that destroys consumer purchasing power undermines markets themselves. Smart policy creates stability and opportunity for responsible businesses.

### For Everyone
This is not about stopping progress. It is about shaping it. Technology should serve human purposes - and humans should decide what those purposes are.
