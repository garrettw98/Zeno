# MONTH 2: Citizen's Royalty DEEP DIVE
## Weeks 5-8: Economics, Evidence, and Implementation

---

## WEEK 5: THE EVIDENCE

### Day 31

**Post 1 - Monday: Evidence Based**
```
HOOK: "People say Citizen's Royalty is an untested idea. They're wrong."

BODY: "We have decades of evidence:

- Alaska Permanent Fund: 40+ years of dividends
- Finland pilot: 2,000 participants, 2 years
- Stockton pilot: 125 participants, 2 years
- Kenya: 20,000+ participants, ongoing
- Canada (Mincome): 1970s experiment

Plus dozens of smaller pilots worldwide.

This month, I'm going to walk you through what the evidence actually shows.
Not ideology. Not theory. Data.

Spoiler: It works better than critics predicted."

CTA: "Which pilot do you want to hear about first?"

HASHTAGS: #Citizen's Royalty #Evidence #Pilots #Data
```

**Post 2 - Alaska**
```
HOOK: "Alaska has had Citizen's Royalty for over 40 years. Here's what happened."

BODY: "Since 1982, every Alaskan resident gets an annual dividend from oil
revenues. It's ranged from $300 to $2,000+ per person.

Results:
- No negative employment effects
- Reduced poverty, especially for rural and Indigenous communities
- Popular across political parties
- Recession buffer during oil price drops

It's not perfect Citizen's Royalty - it's annual not monthly, it varies by year, it's
smaller than what we propose. But it proves the concept works.

40 years. Republican state. Still going strong."

CTA: "Why don't more states do this?"

HASHTAGS: #Alaska #PermanentFund #Citizen's Royalty #Proof

### Day 32

**Post 1 - Finland**
```
HOOK: "Finland tried Citizen's Royalty. The headlines said it failed. They lied."

BODY: "What actually happened:

2,000 unemployed people got 560 euros/month for 2 years, unconditionally.

Results:
- Employment: Same as control group (NOT decreased)
- Wellbeing: Significantly improved
- Stress: Reduced
- Trust in institutions: Increased
- Health: Improved

Why did headlines say 'failed'? Because employment didn't INCREASE. But
that wasn't the goal. The goal was: does Citizen's Royalty hurt employment? No.

The real finding: People are happier, healthier, and just as likely to
work. That's success."

CTA: "Media spun this wrong. Now you know the truth."

HASHTAGS: #Finland #Citizen's Royalty #MediaLies #Truth
```

**Post 2 - Stockton**
```
HOOK: "Stockton, California gave people $500/month. Look what happened."

BODY: "SEED program: 125 people, $500/month, no strings attached.

Results:
- Full-time employment INCREASED by 12%
- Recipients used money for food, utilities, transportation
- Mental health improved
- Financial stability increased
- People felt dignified instead of surveilled

$500 isn't even close to full Citizen's Royalty. And it still had major positive effects.

This wasn't theory. This was Stockton. A real American city with real
American problems."

CTA: "What would YOUR city look like with Citizen's Royalty?"

HASHTAGS: #Stockton #SEED #Citizen's Royalty #California
```

### Day 33

**Post 1 - Kenya**
```
HOOK: "The largest Citizen's Royalty study in history is happening right now in Kenya."

BODY: "GiveDirectly is giving unconditional cash to over 20,000 people for
12 years. Largest, longest Citizen's Royalty study ever.

Early results:
- Business investment increased
- Assets increased
- Nutrition improved
- Education enrollment up
- Psychological wellbeing improved
- No decrease in work

And this is in extreme poverty conditions. If Citizen's Royalty works there, imagine
what it does in a developed economy with existing infrastructure.

The evidence keeps coming. And it keeps saying the same thing."

CTA: "Look up GiveDirectly. Incredible organization."

HASHTAGS: #Kenya #GiveDirectly #Citizen's Royalty #GlobalSouth
```

**Post 2 - What Critics Predicted vs Reality**
```
HOOK: "Here's what critics said would happen with Citizen's Royalty. And what actually
happened."

BODY: "Critics said: People will stop working.
Reality: Employment stayed same or increased.

Critics said: People will waste money on drugs and alcohol.
Reality: Spending on temptation goods decreased in most studies.

Critics said: Inflation will spike.
Reality: Minimal to no inflation in pilots.

Critics said: It's too expensive.
Reality: Pilots demonstrated cost-effectiveness.

The predictions were wrong. The evidence is in. Maybe it's time to update
the priors."

CTA: "What objection do you still have? Let me address it."

HASHTAGS: #Citizen's Royalty #Critics #Evidence #WrongPredictions
```

---

### Day 34

**Post 1 - The Work Incentive Deep Dive**
```
HOOK: "Let's really get into the work question. It deserves a deep look."

BODY: "Why people think Citizen's Royalty reduces work:
- 'If I didn't HAVE to work, I wouldn't'
- Basic economics: if the price of not working goes down, people buy more

Why this is wrong:
- the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) is survival, not luxury. People want more than survival.
- The alternative isn't leisure - it's poverty. Citizen's Royalty just removes poverty.
- Work provides more than money: purpose, social connection, identity.
- Humans are not lazy by nature. Bored humans seek activity.

The evidence confirms: given security, people still choose to work. They
just choose BETTER work."

CTA: "Be honest - would you really do nothing?"

HASHTAGS: #Work #Citizen's Royalty #Incentives #HumanNature
```

**Post 2 - Marginal vs Average**
```
HOOK: "Here's an economics concept that changes everything: marginal
decisions."

BODY: "People don't decide 'work or not work.' They decide 'work MORE or
work LESS.'

With Citizen's Royalty, some people might:
- Work fewer hours (especially overworked people)
- Take time between jobs to find better fits
- Reduce from two jobs to one
- Retire a bit earlier

But dramatic exits from the workforce? Rare. The math doesn't support it.
$24,000/year isn't enough to live well. You'd still want income.

The fear is that everyone quits. The reality is that people adjust on the
margins. That's fine. That's healthy."

CTA: "Would you quit or just... breathe easier?"

HASHTAGS: #Economics #Marginal #Work #Citizen's Royalty
```

### Day 35

**Post 1 - Mothers and Caregivers**
```
HOOK: "Citizen's Royalty recognizes something important: Caregiving is work."

BODY: "Right now, if you stay home to raise kids or care for aging parents,
you get nothing. Your work is invisible to the economy.

But it's real work. Essential work. Society depends on it.

Citizen's Royalty pays caregivers. Not as a special program - as a recognition that their
contribution matters.

A stay-at-home parent would receive the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model). For the first time, the
economy would acknowledge that raising children is valuable.

This isn't about pushing any lifestyle. It's about recognizing ALL work,
not just paid employment."

CTA: "Do you know a caregiver whose work goes unrecognized?"

HASHTAGS: #Caregiving #Parents #Citizen's Royalty #WorkIsWork
```

**Post 2 - Friday Clarity**
```
HOOK: "End of week 5. Let me be crystal clear."

BODY: "The evidence on Citizen's Royalty is not mixed. It's consistent.

Across countries, cultures, income levels, and program designs, the same
patterns appear:
- No significant work reduction
- Improved wellbeing
- Better health outcomes
- Increased security
- No inflation

There are legitimate debates about design and funding. But 'it doesn't work'
is not a legitimate position. The data is in.

If you're still skeptical, tell me what evidence would change your mind."

CTA: "Seriously - what would convince you?"

HASHTAGS: #Evidence #Citizen's Royalty #Data #WeekFive

### Day 36-37

**Weekend content - lighter, Q&A, personal reflection**

---

## WEEK 6: FUNDING DEEP DIVE

### Day 38

**Post 1 - Monday: Let's Talk Money**
```
HOOK: "How do we pay for Citizen's Royalty? Let's do this properly."

BODY: "The cost: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) x 260 million adults = $6.2 trillion gross.

Sounds impossible. But:
1. Much of this is recirculated through taxes
2. We already spend trillions on programs Citizen's Royalty would replace
3. New tax sources become available
4. The net new cost is much smaller

This week, I'm going to break down every funding source. No hand-waving.
Actual numbers. You'll understand exactly how the math works.

Let's start tomorrow with what we already spend."

CTA: "Ready to see how the numbers work?"

HASHTAGS: #Citizen's Royalty #Funding #Money #Math
```

**Post 2 - Current Spending**
```
HOOK: "The government already spends over $2 trillion on income support.
Did you know that?"

BODY: "Current programs that Citizen's Royalty could consolidate or replace:

- Social Security: $1.2 trillion
- Medicare/Medicaid (partial): $800 billion
- SNAP (food stamps): $120 billion
- Housing assistance: $50 billion
- TANF (welfare): $30 billion
- Earned Income Tax Credit: $60 billion
- Unemployment insurance: $40 billion

Total: Over $2 trillion already.

Citizen's Royalty doesn't add $6 trillion to spending. It reorganizes what we already spend
and adds new sources. Very different math."

CTA: "Tomorrow: new revenue sources."

HASHTAGS: #Spending #Budget #Citizen's Royalty #AlreadySpending
```

---

### Day 39

**Post 1 - Value Added Tax**
```
HOOK: "Every developed country except the US has a Value Added Tax. Here's
why we need one."

BODY: "VAT: A tax on consumption at each stage of production. Harder to
evade than income tax. Captures spending by the wealthy.

At 10-15%, a US VAT would raise $1.5-2.5 trillion annually.

'But that's regressive!' Not when paired with Citizen's Royalty.

Think about it: You pay 10% more on purchases. But you receive $24,000/year.
Unless you spend $240,000/year, you come out ahead.

For most Americans, VAT + Citizen's Royalty is massively progressive."

CTA: "Every other developed country does this. Why not us?"

HASHTAGS: #VAT #Tax #Funding #Citizen's Royalty
```

**Post 2 - Automation Tax**
```
HOOK: "When a robot replaces a worker, who pays? Right now, nobody."

BODY: "The automation tax changes that.

Companies that become more productive through automation pay a 15% tax on
those productivity gains. Not on revenue. Not on profit. On the measurable
increase in output per worker.

This captures the value that automation creates and redistributes it. It's
not punishing automation - companies still keep 85% of the gain. But society
shares in the benefit.

Estimated revenue: $200-600 billion, growing as automation increases."

CTA: "Fair or unfair? Let me know."

HASHTAGS: #AutomationTax #Robots #Funding #FairShare
```

---

### Day 40

**Post 1 - Carbon Tax**
```
HOOK: "Carbon tax: Good for the environment AND funds Citizen's Royalty."

BODY: "Put a price on carbon pollution. Start at $30/ton, rise to $100+.

The revenue goes directly to citizens as dividends - or in our case, as
part of Citizen's Royalty.

At $100/ton, this raises $200-400 billion annually.

The beauty: it makes polluting more expensive (changing behavior) while
making sure people can afford the transition (through the dividend).

It's not either-or. It's both-and. Climate action AND economic security."

CTA: "Climate policy that doesn't hurt working people. Novel concept."

HASHTAGS: #CarbonTax #Climate #Citizen's Royalty #GreenDeal
```

**Post 2 - Land Value Tax**
```
HOOK: "Land Value Tax: The tax even libertarians like."

BODY: "Land is fixed. You can't create more. When land values go up, it's
usually because the COMMUNITY improved - better schools, transit, jobs.

Yet landowners capture all that value. They didn't create it. Society did.

Land Value Tax captures community-created value. It can't be evaded - land
can't move offshore. It encourages productive use - empty lots get expensive.

At 2% of land value, this raises $500 billion to $1 trillion annually.

Henry George figured this out in the 1800s. We're still catching up."

CTA: "Should we tax land or labor? Easy choice."

HASHTAGS: #LandValueTax #HenryGeorge #Tax #Funding
```

---

### Day 41

**Post 1 - Tax Recapture**
```
HOOK: "Here's something critics miss: Citizen's Royalty pays for itself partially."

BODY: "When you give someone $24,000, they spend it. That spending generates
economic activity. That activity generates taxes.

If the average effective tax rate on that spending is 25-30%, we recapture
$6,000-7,000 per person. That's $1.5-1.8 trillion flowing back.

This isn't free money - it's circulation. The economy grows. Tax revenue
grows. The net cost is much lower than the gross cost.

Dynamic scoring matters. Static analysis misses the picture."

CTA: "Money moves. It doesn't disappear."

HASHTAGS: #Economics #TaxRecapture #Citizen's Royalty #Circulation
```

**Post 2 - Putting It Together**
```
HOOK: "Let's add it all up. Can we fund Citizen's Royalty or not?"

BODY: "Gross cost: $6.2 trillion

Funding sources:
- Program consolidation: $1-1.5T
- Tax recapture: $1.5-1.8T
- VAT (10-15%): $1.5-2.5T
- Automation tax: $200-600B
- Carbon tax: $200-400B
- Land value tax: $500B-1T

Total potential: $5-8 trillion

The math works. The question is political will.

And remember - this isn't NEW spending on net. It's reorganization plus
reasonable new taxes on consumption, automation, carbon, and land."

CTA: "The math works. Do we have the will?"

### Day 42

**Post 1 - Deficit Neutral**
```
HOOK: "Citizen's Royalty doesn't have to increase the deficit. Here's how."

BODY: "Some people worry Citizen's Royalty means runaway deficits. It doesn't have to.

Option 1: Fully funded by new taxes (shown earlier this week)
Option 2: Partially funded by deficit reduction from other programs
Option 3: Funded by productivity gains over time

The Human Standard proposes Option 1 - fully funded. No tricks. No deficits.
Just different choices about who pays taxes and who receives benefits.

Sound money is part of the platform. We're not proposing to print our way
to prosperity."

CTA: "Fiscal responsibility isn't just a right-wing value."

HASHTAGS: #Deficit #FiscalResponsibility #Citizen's Royalty #SoundMoney
```

**Post 2 - Friday Funding Recap**
```
HOOK: "Week 6 done. Funding summary."

BODY: "The question isn't 'Can we afford Citizen's Royalty?' It's 'What are our priorities?'

We can afford:
- Trillions in tax cuts for the wealthy
- Trillions in military spending
- Trillions in corporate subsidies

But suddenly we 'can't afford' to make sure everyone can eat and have shelter?

The money exists. We just choose to allocate it differently right now.

Citizen's Royalty is a different choice. A better choice."

CTA: "Next week: How Citizen's Royalty actually gets implemented."

HASHTAGS: #Priorities #Funding #Choices #WeekSix

### Days 43-44 - Weekend content

## WEEK 7: IMPLEMENTATION

### Day 45

**Post 1 - Monday: How It Actually Works**
```
HOOK: "Let's get practical. How would Citizen's Royalty actually work?"

BODY: "Day 1: You sign up through IRS or Social Security website.
Bank account or prepaid debit card.

Month 1: First deposit hits. $2,000.

Every month after: Same thing. Automatic. No paperwork.

That's it. No means testing. No recertification. No bureaucracy.

Your income changes? Doesn't matter. You get Citizen's Royalty regardless.
Get a raise? Still get Citizen's Royalty. Lose your job? Still get Citizen's Royalty.

Simple beats complicated every time."

CTA: "What would you do with that first deposit?"

HASHTAGS: #Citizen's Royalty #Implementation #Simple #HowItWorks
```

**Post 2 - Existing Infrastructure**
```
HOOK: "We already have the infrastructure for Citizen's Royalty. We proved it in 2020."

BODY: "Remember stimulus checks? Hundreds of millions of payments went out
in weeks.

The IRS can already:
- Identify every adult American
- Process direct deposits
- Issue physical checks
- Handle address changes

The question isn't whether we CAN send everyone money. We just did it. Three
times. The question is whether we do it permanently.

The infrastructure exists. The policy choice is all that's missing."

CTA: "Did your stimulus check arrive? Then Citizen's Royalty can too."

HASHTAGS: #Stimulus #Infrastructure #IRS #Citizen's Royalty

### Day 46

**Post 1 - Transition Period**
```
HOOK: "We wouldn't flip a switch to full Citizen's Royalty overnight. Here's the transition."

BODY: "Year 1: $500/month. New tax sources begin.
Year 2: $1,000/month. Scaling up.
Year 3: $1,500/month. Program consolidation begins.
Year 4: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model). Full implementation.

Gradual phase-in lets the economy adjust. Lets us catch problems early.
Builds political support as people see it working.

Some programs transition immediately (like SNAP replacement). Others phase
over time (Social Security remains for current recipients).

Thoughtful transition beats sudden revolution."

CTA: "Should it be faster or slower?"

HASHTAGS: #Transition #PhaseIn #Implementation #Citizen's Royalty
```

**Post 2 - What About Current Benefits**
```
HOOK: "Will Citizen's Royalty replace Social Security? SNAP? Disability?"

BODY: "Short answer: It's complicated. But fair.

Social Security: Current recipients can keep it or switch to Citizen's Royalty (whichever
is higher). New workers move to Citizen's Royalty system.

SNAP/Food stamps: Replaced by Citizen's Royalty (cash is more flexible than food stamps).

Disability: Cash portion replaced by Citizen's Royalty. Services continue for those who
need them.

Housing assistance: Complex transition over time. Citizen's Royalty helps with rent but
housing policy still needed.

No one loses out in the transition. That's non-negotiable."

CTA: "Worried about a specific program? Ask me."

HASHTAGS: #SocialSecurity #SNAP #Disability #Transition
```

### Day 47

**Post 1 - State and Local**
```
HOOK: "Citizen's Royalty doesn't have to start federally. States can lead."

BODY: "Nothing stops a state from implementing Citizen's Royalty within its borders.

California could do it. Texas could do it. Any state with political will.

Advantages:
- Proves the concept at scale
- Builds evidence base
- Creates political pressure
- Shows what's possible

Alaska already does a version. What if other states followed?

Federal Citizen's Royalty is the goal. State Citizen's Royalty is the path."

CTA: "What state should go first?"

HASHTAGS: #States #California #Texas #StateCitizen's Royalty
```

**Post 2 - Pilot Expansion**
```
HOOK: "Before full Citizen's Royalty, we could run bigger pilots."

BODY: "The current pilots are small. Hundreds of people. Limited duration.

What if we did:
- Whole city pilots (100,000+ people)
- Multi-year duration (5+ years)
- Full Citizen's Royalty amount (the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model))
- Rigorous measurement

This would generate definitive data. Answer remaining questions. Build
political support.

Several cities are already exploring this. The movement is growing."

CTA: "Would your city volunteer for a pilot?"

HASHTAGS: #Pilots #Cities #Expansion #Evidence
```

### Day 48

**Post 1 - Political Path**
```
HOOK: "How does Citizen's Royalty actually become law? Let's be realistic."

BODY: "Path 1: Legislation
- Introduce bill
- Build coalition (needs 60 Senate votes or reconciliation)
- Pass and implement

Path 2: State-first
- States pass Citizen's Royalty
- Proves concept
- Federal follows

Path 3: Crisis response
- Economic crisis hits
- Emergency Citizen's Royalty passed
- Becomes permanent

Realistically? Probably some combination. That's why we build the
framework now - so it's ready when the moment comes."

CTA: "Which path do you think is most likely?"

HASHTAGS: #Politics #Legislation #Path #Citizen's Royalty
```

**Post 2 - Friday: Why It Hasn't Happened Yet**
```
HOOK: "If Citizen's Royalty is so great, why hasn't it happened?"

BODY: "Honest answer:

1. Inertia. The current system has defenders. Bureaucracies. Jobs.

2. Ideology. Left distrusts cash (want services). Right distrusts universal
(want means-testing).

3. Funding. New taxes are hard. Reorganization is hard.

4. Fear. Politicians avoid big changes.

5. Timing. The crisis hasn't forced action yet.

None of these are permanent. Automation changes the equation. Economic
insecurity grows. The arguments for Citizen's Royalty get stronger every year.

The question is when, not if."

CTA: "What do you think is the biggest obstacle?"

## WEEK 8: Citizen's Royalty AND YOU

### Day 52

**Post 1 - Monday: Personal Impact**
```
HOOK: "Let's make this personal. How would Citizen's Royalty change YOUR life?"

BODY: "Think about it:

A guaranteed income floor. No matter what.

Would you:
- Finally have an emergency fund?
- Leave that job you hate?
- Start the business you've dreamed about?
- Go back to school?
- Take care of a family member?
- Just... breathe easier?

Citizen's Royalty isn't abstract policy. It's your life getting better. That's what
we're fighting for."

CTA: "Tell me - what would you do?"

HASHTAGS: #Citizen's Royalty #PersonalImpact #YourLife #Dreams
```

**Post 2 - Security Changes Everything**
```
HOOK: "What does it feel like to not be afraid of homelessness?"

BODY: "Most Americans have never felt truly secure. One medical bill, one
job loss, one crisis - and it all falls apart.

That fear changes how you think. What risks you take. What you tolerate.

With Citizen's Royalty, the floor disappears. The worst case isn't disaster anymore. It's
just... the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model). You'll be okay.

That psychological shift is massive. Studies show that financial security
changes how people plan, dream, and act.

Security isn't luxury. It's freedom."

CTA: "When's the last time you felt truly secure?"

### Days 53-58 - Personal stories, Q&A, applications, month wrap

**Day 58 - Month 2 Wrap**
```
HOOK: "Two months down. Here's what we covered on Citizen's Royalty."

BODY: "Month 2 deep dive:

- The evidence: Alaska, Finland, Stockton, Kenya. It works.
- The work question: People don't stop working. They work better.
- The funding: VAT, automation tax, carbon, land, consolidation. It adds up.
- The implementation: Gradual phase-in. Use existing infrastructure.
- The politics: Hard but possible. State-first or crisis response.
- The personal: What would YOU do with security?

Citizen's Royalty is the foundation of The Human Standard. It makes everything else
possible.

Month 3: AI and Automation - the reason we need all this."
