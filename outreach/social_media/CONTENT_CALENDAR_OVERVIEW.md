1. **Reply to big accounts** discussing automation, AI, economics
2. **Duet/stitch** viral content about jobs, economy, technology
3. **Consistent posting time** - algorithm rewards reliability
4. **Strong hooks** in first 3 seconds - pattern interrupt
5. **End with engagement prompt** - question, challenge, or cliffhanger

## RECORDING TIPS

- Film in batches (record a week at a time)
- Same background/lighting for brand consistency
- Look at camera lens, not screen
- Speak with energy, slightly faster than normal
- Keep scripts as bullet points, not word-for-word
- Natural pauses are fine, ums/uhs can be edited

**Month 1-2:** Focus on consistency, not numbers
**Month 3-4:** Aim for 1-2 viral posts, growing follower base
**Month 5-6:** Community engagement, email list building, real-world action
