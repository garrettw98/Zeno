# METHODOLOGY AND CONFIDENCE LEVELS
## Understanding Claims, Projections, and Uncertainty in The Human Standard
### By Zeno

---

## PURPOSE

This document provides transparency about the methodology, evidence bases, and confidence levels for claims made throughout The Human Standard materials. Intellectual honesty requires distinguishing between:

1. **Historical Facts** - Events that have occurred
2. **Current Data** - Present-day measurements and observations
3. **Projections** - Evidence-based forecasts with stated assumptions
4. **Speculation** - Informed hypotheses with significant uncertainty
5. **Normative Claims** - Value judgments and policy recommendations

## SECTION 1: AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY CLAIMS

### 1.1 Current State of Technology

| Claim | Evidence Type | Confidence | Source Type |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| AI can perform many cognitive tasks | Current data | HIGH | Published benchmarks |
| Humanoid robots exist and function | Current data | HIGH | Commercial announcements |
| Autonomous vehicles operate (limited) | Current data | HIGH | Deployment data |
| GPT-class models exceed human baseline on many tasks | Current data | HIGH | Academic testing |

### 1.2 Deployment Projections

| Claim | Evidence Type | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Tesla Optimus: 50-100K units by 2026 | Company projection | LOW-MEDIUM | Tesla often misses timelines |
| Humanoid robots in millions by 2030 | Projection | MEDIUM | Depends on manufacturing scale |
| Significant job displacement by 2035 | Projection | MEDIUM | Wide range of estimates |
| AGI by 2030 | Speculation | LOW | Expert disagreement substantial |

### 1.3 Methodology for Technology Claims

**We use:**
- Published company announcements (with skepticism)
- Academic research and benchmarks
- Industry analyst reports
- Historical precedent for technology adoption rates

**We acknowledge:**
- Short-term forecasts often overstated
- Long-term impact often understated
- Deployment depends on many non-technical factors
- Uncertainty increases with time horizon

## SECTION 2: ECONOMIC AND FISCAL CLAIMS

### 2.1 Revenue Projections

| Revenue Source | Estimate | Confidence | Methodology |
|----------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| VAT (10-15%) | $1.5-2.5T | HIGH | Based on consumption data and international VAT systems |
| Automation Tax (15%) | $200-600B | MEDIUM | Based on productivity scenarios |
| Carbon Tax ($100/ton) | $200-400B | HIGH | Based on emissions data and elasticity studies |
| Data Tax | $50-200B | MEDIUM | Based on platform revenue data |
| Land Value Tax (2%) | $500B-1T | MEDIUM | Based on land value estimates (wide range) |
| Wealth Tax | $200-400B | LOW | High evasion uncertainty, constitutional questions |

### 2.2 Cost Projections

| Program | Cost Estimate | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| UBI at $2000/month | $6.2T gross | HIGH | Simple arithmetic |
| Tax recapture | $1T | MEDIUM | Depends on rate structure |
| Program replacement | $1-1.5T | MEDIUM | Depends on policy choices |
| Net new funding | $3-4T | MEDIUM | Sum of above with ranges |

### 2.3 Economic Effects

| Claim | Confidence | Evidence Base |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| UBI reduces poverty | HIGH | Pilot program evidence |
| UBI doesn't significantly reduce work | MEDIUM-HIGH | Pilot evidence, but universal differs from pilot |
| UBI may cause some inflation | MEDIUM | Economic theory, depends on implementation |
| Automation tax doesn't kill innovation | MEDIUM | Revenue-neutral design, no direct precedent |

### 2.4 Methodology for Economic Claims

**We use:**
- Government economic data (BLS, CBO, Census)
- Academic economic research
- International comparisons
- Historical precedent
- Economic modeling (with stated assumptions)

**We acknowledge:**
- Economic projections are inherently uncertain
- Behavioral effects are hard to predict
- International experience may not transfer
- Political economy affects outcomes

## SECTION 3: POLITICAL AND IMPLEMENTATION CLAIMS

### 3.1 Feasibility Assessments

| Claim | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Cross-partisan coalition possible | MEDIUM | Historical precedent exists, current polarization challenging |
| Constitutional authority for UBI | HIGH | Spending power well-established |
| Constitutional authority for automation tax | HIGH | Tax power well-established |
| Constitutional authority for wealth tax | LOW | Direct tax clause creates uncertainty |
| State-level implementation viable | HIGH | States can act independently |

### 3.2 Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Estimate | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| Foundation (Year 1-2) | 2025-2027 | MEDIUM | Depends on election outcomes |
| Expansion (Year 3-4) | 2027-2029 | LOW-MEDIUM | Depends on political success |
| Full Implementation (Year 5-7) | 2029-2032 | LOW | Many variables |

### 3.3 Methodology for Political Claims

**We use:**
- Historical precedent for major legislation
- Constitutional law analysis
- Political science research
- Expert commentary

**We acknowledge:**
- Political predictions are highly uncertain
- Individual actors can shift outcomes
- Crises create unpredictable opportunities
- Timeline estimates are aspirational

## SECTION 4: CLAIMS REQUIRING SPECIAL CAUTION

### 4.1 High Uncertainty Areas

**AGI Timeline:**
- Experts disagree fundamentally
- Could be 5 years or 50 years
- We prepare for multiple scenarios
- No claim to know the answer

**Behavioral Effects at Scale:**
- Pilots are not universal programs
- Cultural change takes generations
- Unintended consequences likely
- Humility appropriate

**International Coordination:**
- Geopolitical environment unpredictable
- Cooperation not guaranteed
- Fallback plans necessary
- Success not assumed

### 4.2 Areas of Genuine Ignorance

**We don't know:**
- Exactly when AGI will arrive
- Exactly how many jobs will be displaced
- Exactly how people will respond to universal UBI
- Whether our political strategy will succeed
- What unforeseen challenges will emerge

**We do know:**
- Preparation is better than reaction
- Multiple scenarios should be planned for
- Policies should be adaptive
- Humility is appropriate

## SECTION 5: STANDARDS FOR CLAIMS IN HUMAN STANDARD MATERIALS

### 5.1 Labeling Standards

Throughout The Human Standard materials, claims should be understood as follows:

**"Is" / "Has" / "Does"** → Historical fact or current data (verifiable)

**"Will" (with year)** → Projection (stated assumptions apply)

**"Could" / "May" / "Might"** → Possibility (acknowledging uncertainty)

**"Should" / "Must"** → Normative claim (value judgment)

**"We estimate" / "We project"** → Quantitative forecast (with stated confidence)

### 5.2 Updating Claims

**The Human Standard commits to:**
- Updating projections as new data emerges
- Correcting errors when identified
- Acknowledging when predictions prove wrong
- Maintaining version history

**We invite:**
- Fact-checking and scrutiny
- Identification of errors
- Alternative analyses
- Debate on methodology

| Government statistics | BLS, CBO, Census, Fed | HIGH |
| Academic peer-reviewed | Major economics journals | HIGH |
| Think tank research | Brookings, AEI, etc. | MEDIUM-HIGH (consider bias) |
| Company announcements | Earnings, product claims | MEDIUM (verify independently) |
| News reporting | Major outlets | MEDIUM (check primary sources) |
| Expert commentary | Named experts | MEDIUM (consider expertise and bias) |

## SECTION 7: EVOLVING UNDERSTANDING

### 7.1 What We've Learned Since Initial Publication

*[This section to be updated as the document evolves]*

- Initial projections that proved accurate
- Projections that required revision
- New evidence affecting recommendations
- Policy adjustments made

### 7.2 Outstanding Questions

**Questions we're actively researching:**
- Optimal UBI amount for work incentives
- International coordination mechanisms
- Constitutional questions on wealth taxation
- Behavioral effects of universal (vs. pilot) UBI

**Questions we acknowledge we cannot answer:**
- AGI arrival date
- Political feasibility in current environment
- Long-term cultural effects

## CONCLUSION

**The Human Standard values intellectual honesty.**

We make strong claims where evidence is strong.
We acknowledge uncertainty where it exists.
We distinguish projection from speculation.
We invite scrutiny and correction.

No political philosophy should claim omniscience. Ours doesn't. But we believe our analysis is sound, our reasoning is transparent, and our proposals are worth debating on their merits.
