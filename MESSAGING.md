## Introduction

Ideas don't spread themselves. Movements are built one conversation at a time. This document equips supporters to talk about The Human Standard—at the dinner table, on social media, in the elevator, or on a stage.

Every message here serves one goal: make the complex simple without making it simplistic.

---

## Part I: The Core Message

### The Tagline

**Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around.**

This is the foundation. Everything else builds on it.

### The One-Sentence Summary

The Human Standard ensures that AI and automation benefit everyone—not just those who own the machines—through the Sovereign Humanity Fund, the Citizen's Royalty (Negative Income Tax), tiered AI governance transparency, and purchasing power stability.

### The Three-Sentence Version

Technology is about to automate millions of jobs. Right now, all that wealth flows to the people who own the machines. The Human Standard changes that—it makes sure everyone gets a share, government works for the people, and your money holds its value.

---

## Part II: Elevator Pitches

### The 30-Second Pitch

"AI and robots are going to do most of the work humans do now. That could be amazing—or it could be a disaster. It depends on who gets the benefits. Right now, all that wealth goes to the people who own the technology. The Human Standard says: no. That wealth belongs to everyone. Through the Sovereign Humanity Fund, citizens become shareholders in AI companies. The Citizen's Royalty—a Negative Income Tax—guarantees no one falls below $24,000/year while rewarding work. AI governance balances transparency with security. Your savings stay stable. Technology serves humanity—not the other way around."

### The 2-Minute Pitch

"We're facing the biggest economic transformation in human history. AI and automation are going to change everything—and fast. Not in fifty years. In the next ten.

Here's the problem: the way things are set up now, all those gains go to a tiny number of people. The rest of us get displaced, our savings get inflated away, and we can't even trust what we see online anymore because of deepfakes.

The Human Standard is a complete framework for making this transition work for everyone. Four main pieces:

First, we tax automation fairly. Companies that replace workers with robots pay into a fund that benefits everyone. Not to punish technology—to share its gains.

Second, universal basic income. Everyone gets a monthly check, no strings attached. Not because people are lazy—evidence shows they're not—but because everyone deserves to share in the wealth that technology creates.

Third, transparent AI in government. Open source, auditable, no corruption. AI can process benefits and permits without playing favorites—but humans still set the rules and handle appeals.

Fourth, sound money. Options to save in currencies that can't be inflated away. Your savings should hold their value.

The philosophy is simple: technology serves humanity, not the other way around. That's The Human Standard."

### The 10-Minute Pitch

*Use the 2-minute pitch as the opening, then expand with:*

**The Three Crises:**
"We're not facing one crisis—we're facing three at once, and they reinforce each other.

The automation crisis: AI can now do cognitive work, not just physical labor. Lawyers, accountants, writers, customer service, programmers—every white-collar job is affected. This isn't decades away. It's happening now.

The monetary crisis: The dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power since 1913. That's not an accident—it's policy. Inflation is a hidden tax that benefits debtors and asset owners at the expense of savers and workers. Your grandparents could buy a house on one income. You can barely afford rent on two.

The trust crisis: You can't trust what you see anymore. Deepfakes can make anyone appear to say anything. An 82-year-old man lost his entire retirement—$690,000—to a deepfake of Elon Musk. How do we have democracy when we can't agree on what's real?"

**The Evidence:**
"This isn't theory. We have evidence.

Stockton, California gave 125 people $500 a month, no strings attached. Employment went UP, not down. People used the money for food, bills, and their kids. Only 1% went to alcohol and tobacco.

Finland gave 2,000 people basic income. They weren't more likely to find jobs—but they were happier, less stressed, and more trusting of other people.

Alaska has given every resident an annual dividend since 1982. Forty years. No collapse of work ethic. No dependency spiral. One of the most equal states in America.

Kenya: unconditional cash transfers cut infant mortality by 48%. People started businesses, bought equipment, built better homes.

The fear that people will do nothing is not supported by evidence. It's a story we tell ourselves to justify a system that isn't working."

**The Coalition:**
"This isn't left or right. Think about who agrees with parts of this:

Libertarians love sound money, hate government bureaucracy, want individual freedom. We offer Bitcoin-friendly policy and AI that reduces corrupt bureaucrats.

Progressives want worker protection, universal programs, anti-corruption measures. We offer UBI funded by taxing the gains from automation.

Populists are angry at elites extracting wealth while regular people struggle. We're channeling that anger into structural solutions.

Technologists know AI governance matters and open source works. We're building the framework they've been asking for.

The automation age scrambles the old alliances. People who understand what's coming have more in common with each other than with those in their traditional camps who deny the transformation."

**The Call:**
"This is a thirty-year project. We're at the beginning. Right now we need people who understand the vision to spread it—in conversations, online, in their communities.

The crisis is coming whether we're ready or not. Our job is to make sure The Human Standard is the obvious answer when people start asking questions.

Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around. That's what we're building."

## Part III: Audience-Specific Messages

### For Workers Worried About Their Jobs

**Lead with empathy, then empower:**

"You're right to be worried. AI is coming for a lot of jobs—not just factory work, but office work, professional work. The people telling you not to worry are either lying or not paying attention.

But here's the thing: technology creating wealth isn't the problem. The problem is who gets that wealth. Right now, it all flows to shareholders and executives. You get displaced.

The Human Standard changes that equation. When a robot does your job, you get a share of what it produces. Not charity—your share. You helped build this economy. You deserve to benefit when it gets more productive.

We're not anti-technology. We're anti-exploitation. There's a difference."

### For Entrepreneurs and Business Owners

**Frame as opportunity:**

"Think about what UBI means for entrepreneurship. Right now, most people can't take risks because they're one missed paycheck from disaster. They stay in jobs they hate because they need the health insurance.

With basic income, everyone has a floor. That means more people can start businesses, try new ideas, create things. Your customer base expands because people have money to spend. Your talent pool expands because people can afford to work for startups.

And sound money? That means your savings and your business's cash reserves hold their value. You're not losing 3-7% a year to inflation.

This isn't anti-business. It's pro-market. Real markets need customers with money and entrepreneurs who can take risks."

### For Parents

**Focus on the future:**

"What world will your kids inherit?

The way things are going: they'll compete with AI for jobs, watch their savings inflate away, never afford a house, and not know what to believe online.

The Human Standard builds something different: a world where technology works for them, where they have security to pursue what matters, where they can trust what they see.

This isn't about us. It's about them. We're the generation that either gets this right or leaves them a mess."

### For Libertarians (VERSION 2.0 - Property Rights Frame)

**Emphasize property rights, not welfare:**

"This isn't welfare. It's property rights.

Your data has value. Every search, every purchase, every location ping—corporations extract over $1,000 per year from each American's data. You never consented. You were never compensated. That's theft.

The Citizen's Royalty isn't charity. It's restitution for stolen property, plus your dividend from the public infrastructure—roads, internet backbone, GPS, court system—that makes corporate profits possible.

And here's what Milton Friedman understood: the Negative Income Tax model has built-in work incentives. Every dollar you earn increases your total income. No welfare cliff. No bureaucrats deciding what you can buy. Just money—your money—returned to you.

The Sovereign Humanity Fund takes equity stakes in AI companies, not taxes. As a citizen, you become a shareholder in the AI economy. That's not socialism—that's capitalism working for everyone.

Plus: purchasing power stability. We're the only movement proposing a diversified reserve that protects your savings from BOTH inflation AND deflation. Transparent rules, no Fed manipulation.

This is freedom from corporate data theft AND government bureaucracy."

### For Progressives

**Emphasize justice and universality:**

"Everything you've fought for—living wages, worker dignity, healthcare access, fighting inequality—automation threatens to undo it all.

When AI can do any job, employers have all the power. Wages race to zero. No amount of minimum wage laws matter when there's always a machine that works for less.

The Human Standard addresses root causes. Universal basic income isn't a safety net—it's a dividend. Everyone shares in the wealth that technology creates. Universal healthcare untied from employment. AI in government that actually treats everyone equally—the senator's nephew and the immigrant's daughter get the same treatment.

This is the progressive vision adapted for the automation age. Same values, updated strategy."

### For Skeptics and Cynics

**Acknowledge, then redirect:**

"You're right not to trust politicians, corporations, or anyone promising utopia. The track record is terrible.

Here's what's different about The Human Standard:

One—it's open source. The ideas are public. No hidden agenda. Criticize it, improve it, use it. No one owns it.

Two—it's built on transparency. We're not asking you to trust AI. We're demanding that AI be auditable. Open source code. Human oversight. If you can't inspect it, it shouldn't govern you.

Three—the alternative is worse. Automation is happening regardless. Without policy, all the gains go to a handful of billionaires and everyone else fights for scraps. That's not cynicism—that's trajectory.

You don't have to believe this will work. Just ask yourself: what's your alternative? Because 'do nothing' isn't neutral. It's choosing the current path."

## Part IV: Social Media Templates

### Twitter/X (280 characters)

**The Hook:**
"AI is about to automate millions of jobs. The only question: do the gains go to everyone, or just billionaires? The Human Standard: technology serves humanity."

**The Stat:**
"Stockton gave 125 people $500/month. Employment went UP. Spending on alcohol: 1%. The 'people will be lazy' argument? Exposed as myth."

**The Question:**
"If a robot does your job, should you get nothing while shareholders get everything? That's the current plan. We have a better one."

**The Challenge:**
"The dollar has lost 96% of its value since 1913. Your grandparents could afford a house on one income. What happened? And who benefited?"

**The Vision:**
"2040 with The Human Standard: automation dividend in your account, work optional for survival, government you can actually audit. Possible—if we build it."

### LinkedIn (Professional)

"The automation transformation isn't coming—it's here. AI replaced 700 customer service jobs at Klarna. Copywriters are being let go for ChatGPT. The question isn't whether this will affect your industry. It's when.

The Human Standard offers a framework: tax automation fairly, distribute the gains broadly, make AI governance transparent. Not anti-technology—pro-human.

This isn't left vs. right. It's about whether the next technological revolution benefits everyone or just capital owners. Worth thinking about."

### Instagram/Visual (Caption)

"She had bad teeth for two years. Couldn't afford to fix them. Hid her smile.

Then Stockton gave her $500/month, no strings attached.

She bought dentures.

Now she can smile.

This is what basic income actually does. Not dependency. Dignity.

#TheHumanStandard #UBI #HumanDignity"

### Facebook (Longer form)

"I used to think universal basic income was crazy. Free money? People would just be lazy.

Then I looked at the evidence.

Stockton, CA: Gave people $500/month. Employment went UP. They spent it on food, bills, kids' education. Only 1% on alcohol.

Finland: People were happier, less stressed, more trusting. No collapse of work ethic.

Alaska: Been doing this for 40 years. Still a functioning society.

Kenya: Cash transfers cut infant mortality by 48%.

The 'people will do nothing' story? It's a myth we tell ourselves to justify a system that's failing most of us.

AI is about to automate millions of jobs. The question is: who gets the benefits? The Human Standard says everyone. That's not radical. That's fair."

---

## Part V: Dinner Table Explanations

### "What is The Human Standard?"

Simple version: "It's a plan for making sure AI and robots benefit everyone, not just tech billionaires. Tax automation, give everyone a share, make government AI transparent, protect your savings from inflation."

### "Isn't that just socialism?"

"No—socialism is government owning the means of production. This is capitalism with guardrails. Companies still compete. Markets still work. We just make sure the gains from technology flow to everyone, not just shareholders. Think of it like Alaska—they've given everyone an oil dividend since 1982. Still capitalist. Just fair."

### "Won't people just stop working?"

"The evidence says no. Every UBI experiment shows employment stays the same or goes UP. Stockton, Finland, Kenya—same result. People aren't lazy. They're trapped. Give them a floor, they take risks, start businesses, care for family, contribute to community. The lazy couch potato is a myth."

### "How do you pay for it?"

"Tax automation. When a company replaces workers with robots, they're capturing value that used to go to wages. We take a share of that—not to punish technology, but to share its gains. Also: consolidate existing welfare programs (which are expensive and inefficient), savings from AI government administration, and the economic growth from people having money to spend."

### "This sounds too good to be true."

"It's not utopia. It's policy. Alaska has done dividends for 40 years. Social Security has existed since 1935. Medicare since 1965. Every major program was 'impossible' until it happened. The question isn't whether it's possible—it's whether we choose to do it."

---

## Part VI: Handling Objections

### "Technology always creates more jobs than it destroys."

"That was true when we automated muscles. We're now automating minds. There's no 'next sector' for displaced cognitive workers to move to. And even if new jobs emerge, the transition is brutal. Ask the factory workers from 2000—41% were still unemployed or out of the workforce three years later. We can't just let people suffer and hope it works out."

### "The rich will just leave if you tax them."

"They need access to American consumers—the world's largest market. They need American infrastructure, legal systems, and talent. And we're not taxing income—we're taxing automation value created here. Can't offshore that. Besides, the race to the bottom on taxes has already failed workers. Time to try something else."

### "I don't trust AI in government."

"Neither do we—that's why we demand it be open source and auditable. Right now, government is full of corrupt humans making decisions you can't inspect. AI following transparent rules that anyone can audit is actually MORE trustworthy. And humans always stay in the loop for appeals and policy decisions."

### "Bitcoin/crypto is a scam."

"We don't mandate Bitcoin. We offer options. The dollar has lost 96% of its value since 1913—is that not a scam? We're saying: let people choose. Some will prefer dollars. Some will prefer alternatives. Why should government force everyone into money it can debase?"

### "This will never pass politically."

"Social Security was radical in 1935. Civil Rights was impossible in 1960. Every major change faces opposition until crisis makes it necessary. AI displacement is accelerating. When millions are unemployed and angry, they'll demand solutions. Our job is to have the solution ready."

## Part VII: Key Phrases and Language Guide

### Use These Phrases (VERSION 2.0 UPDATED)

| Phrase | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| "Technology serves humanity" | Clear, memorable, moral |
| "Citizen's Royalty" | Ownership language, implies what you're OWED |
| "Your data dividend" | Makes clear it's compensation for property |
| "Return on public investment" | Frames as earned, not given |
| "Sovereign Humanity Fund" | Citizens as shareholders, not dependents |
| "Purchasing power stability" | Avoids deflation concerns of "sound money" |
| "Tiered transparency" | Balances accountability with security |
| "Not left or right—forward" | Escapes tribal framing |
| "The evidence shows" | Grounds claims in reality |
| "60% more affordable" | Addresses fiscal concerns directly |

### Avoid These Phrases (VERSION 2.0 UPDATED)

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "Free money" | Sounds unearned | "Your data dividend" or "Citizen's Royalty" |
| "Welfare" | Stigmatized | "Citizen's Royalty" or "Negative Income Tax" |
| "UBI" | Associated with unaffordable flat payments | "Citizen's Royalty" (targeted, affordable) |
| "Redistribute" | Triggers opposition | "Return on your data" or "Your share" |
| "Government program" | Sounds bureaucratic | "Direct payment through tax system" |
| "Sound Money" | Can imply harmful deflation | "Purchasing Power Stability" |
| "100% Bitcoin" | Sounds volatile, risky | "Diversified Strategic Reserve" |
| "Total Open Source" | Ignores security concerns | "Tiered Transparency Framework" |

### Framing Principles

1. **Share, don't redistribute.** Redistribution implies taking from those who earned it. Sharing implies everyone has a rightful claim.

2. **Dividend, not welfare.** A dividend is something you're owed. Welfare is something you're given.

3. **Transition, not revolution.** Transition is managed and safe. Revolution is chaotic and scary.

4. **Evidence, not ideology.** Always ground claims in data. "The studies show..." is more persuasive than "I believe..."

5. **Future, not past.** This is about building something new, not returning to something old.

**THE HUMAN STANDARD**
*Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around.*

**THE PROBLEM:**
- AI/automation will displace millions of jobs
- All gains currently flow to capital owners
- Inflation erodes savings (dollar down 96% since 1913)
- Deepfakes make truth unverifiable

**THE SOLUTION:**
- Tax automation → fund automation dividend (UBI)
- Open source AI in government → transparent, auditable
- Sound money options → savings that hold value
- Truth infrastructure → verify what's real

**THE EVIDENCE:**
- Stockton UBI: employment UP, 1% spent on alcohol
- Finland: happier, less stressed, more trusting
- Alaska: 40 years of dividends, no dependency
- Kenya: 48% reduction in infant mortality

**THE PITCH (30 seconds):**
"AI is going to do most human jobs. That could be great or terrible—depends on who gets the benefits. Right now, all gains go to tech billionaires. The Human Standard says everyone deserves a share. Tax automation, give everyone a dividend, make AI transparent, protect savings. Technology serves humanity—not the other way around."
