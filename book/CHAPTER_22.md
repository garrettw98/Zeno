# Chapter 22
## Global Convergence

---

The challenges this book addresses are not uniquely American. Automation displaces workers in every country. Deepfakes threaten truth everywhere. Climate change recognizes no borders. AI concentration affects the global economy.

If the Human Standard succeeds in America, it provides only partial protection. American workers compete with workers worldwide. American companies operate globally. American consumers buy goods made under every nation's rules.

Shared challenges require shared solutions. The question is what form that sharing takes.

This chapter describes the path from national policy to international coordination to federated global governance—not world government, but cooperation that addresses problems no nation can solve alone.

### Why National Solutions Are Insufficient

Consider automation policy in isolation.

If America implements an automation tax while other nations do not, several problems emerge:

**Competitive disadvantage**: American companies face higher costs than foreign competitors. Some production moves overseas. The tax raises revenue but exports jobs.

**Race to the bottom**: Other nations may lower their taxes to attract automated production. The competition drives all taxes toward zero.

**Regulatory arbitrage**: Global companies structure operations to minimize automation tax exposure. The tax is evaded rather than paid.

**Partial benefit**: American workers receive Citizen's Royalty; workers elsewhere do not. Global inequality persists even as domestic inequality is addressed.

Similar dynamics apply to other policies:

- **Open-source mandates**: If only American AI is open-source, it may be disadvantaged against closed-source competitors.
- **Sound money**: If only America recognizes crypto, its benefits are limited to American citizens.
- **Truth infrastructure**: If only American content is blockchain-verified, global information remains untrustworthy.

National policy is necessary but not sufficient. International coordination extends benefits and prevents races to the bottom.

### Phase 1: Bilateral AI Governance Treaties

The first phase of international coordination involves agreements with allies.

**Partners**: Begin with democratic allies—Canada, UK, EU, Japan, Australia, South Korea. These nations share values and face similar challenges.

**Content**:

- Mutual recognition of AI safety standards
- Information sharing on AI development and deployment
- Coordinated research on alignment and safety
- Common principles for algorithmic governance
- Harmonized automation impact reporting

**Mechanism**:

- Bilateral treaties negotiated through normal diplomatic process
- Regular ministerial consultations on AI governance
- Technical working groups on implementation
- Dispute resolution through existing mechanisms

**Scope**:

Early agreements are narrow—establishing common principles rather than detailed rules. Trust builds through cooperation on less sensitive issues. Deeper coordination follows demonstrated success.

**Timeline**: 2026-2030

---

### Phase 2: Regional Integration

The second phase deepens coordination within regions.

**North America**:

- US-Canada-Mexico AI governance framework
- Common standards for automated systems
- Shared infrastructure for content verification
- Coordinated approach to automation displacement

**Trans-Atlantic**:

- US-EU AI treaty
- Mutual recognition of AI regulations
- Coordinated antitrust approach to AI concentration
- Joint research programs

**Asia-Pacific**:

- US-Japan-Australia-South Korea coordination
- Common approach to AI ethics
- Shared standards for autonomous systems
- Coordinated engagement with China

**Regional Coordination Benefits**:

- Larger markets make regulation more effective
- Coordination prevents races to the bottom
- Shared standards reduce compliance costs
- United democratic front strengthens negotiating position

**Timeline**: 2030-2040

---

### Phase 3: Great Power Coordination

The third phase addresses the difficult problem: cooperation with rivals.

**The China Question**:

China is developing AI aggressively. Its approach differs fundamentally from democratic values:
- Surveillance orientation (social credit, facial recognition)
- State control of AI development
- Closed systems serving party interests
- Disregard for individual rights

America cannot force China to adopt Human Standard principles. But some coordination is possible and necessary.

**Mutual Extinction Risks**:

Certain risks threaten everyone regardless of political system:
- AGI safety: Misaligned superintelligence threatens all nations
- Autonomous weapons: AI-driven warfare could escalate beyond control
- Environmental collapse: Climate change affects everyone
- Pandemic response: AI-enabled bioweapons threaten humanity

On these risks, even rivals have shared interest in coordination. The USSR and USA cooperated on nuclear arms control despite fundamental hostility. China and America can cooperate on AI safety even while competing strategically.

**Mechanisms**:

- Track 1.5 diplomacy: Informal discussions involving government and experts
- Technical agreements: Narrow cooperation on specific risks
- Verification protocols: Mechanisms to ensure compliance
- Crisis management: Communication channels to prevent escalation

**Timeline**: 2030-2050

### Phase 4: Federated Global Governance

The fourth phase is most ambitious: governance structures for shared global challenges.

**Not World Government**:

This is explicitly not a proposal for world government. The history of such proposals is one of failure—nations will not surrender sovereignty to supranational authority. Any attempt to impose global government would fail and deserves to fail.

**Subsidiarity Principle**:

Instead, federated governance follows the principle of subsidiarity: decisions should be made at the lowest level capable of addressing them effectively.

- Local matters: local government
- National matters: national government
- Regional matters: regional coordination
- Global matters: global coordination

Only problems that cannot be addressed at lower levels rise to global coordination. This is a limited set:
- Climate change
- Pandemic response
- AI safety
- Nuclear security
- Space governance
- Ocean management

**Structure**:

Global coordination might include:

**AI Safety Council**: International body that monitors AI development, identifies risks, and coordinates responses. Similar to IAEA for nuclear but for AI.

**Content Authenticity Standards**: Global technical standards for blockchain verification. International recognition of verified content.

**Climate Implementation**: Coordinated carbon pricing, technology transfer, adaptation funding. Implementation mechanisms for existing agreements.

**Pandemic Preparedness**: Early warning systems, response coordination, technology sharing. Building on WHO but with stronger mechanisms.

**Space Governance**: Rules for space resources, debris management, militarization limits. Extending existing space treaties.

**Ocean Management**: High seas governance, fishing regulation, seabed resource allocation. Strengthening existing frameworks.

Each of these involves coordination, not government. Nations retain sovereignty. Participation is voluntary (though with consequences for non-participation). Decisions require consensus or supermajority rather than majority imposition.

**Timeline**: 2040-2055+

### The Global AI Constitution

At the center of global AI coordination is a shared document: the Global AI Constitution.

**Content**:

The Constitution establishes principles that all participating nations accept:

1. **Human Dignity**: AI must respect human dignity in all nations
2. **Democratic Control**: AI must be subject to democratic oversight where democracy exists
3. **Transparency**: AI decision systems must be auditable
4. **Non-Discrimination**: AI must not discriminate based on protected characteristics
5. **Safety**: AI development must prioritize safety over speed
6. **Human Override**: Humans must be able to override AI decisions
7. **Benefit Sharing**: AI's economic benefits must be broadly shared

**Mechanism**:

- Nations sign the Constitution voluntarily
- Signatories agree to implement principles domestically
- Regular review conferences assess compliance
- Non-signatories face coordination penalties (exclusion from AI cooperation)

**Enforcement**:

The Constitution is not enforced by global police. It is enforced through:
- Reputational consequences for violation
- Exclusion from coordination benefits
- Economic pressure from participating nations
- Technical barriers (non-compliant systems excluded from interoperability)

This is soft governance—influence rather than coercion—but soft governance can be effective when widely adopted.

### American Leadership

Global convergence requires American leadership.

**Why America**:

- America has the largest AI industry
- America has the strongest democratic institutions
- America has the diplomatic capacity to convene coordination
- American values—democracy, freedom, human dignity—provide a foundation for global principles

If America does not lead, either China leads (with authoritarian principles) or no one leads (with dangerous fragmentation).

**How America Leads**:

- **Demonstration**: Implement Human Standard domestically, proving effectiveness
- **Diplomacy**: Negotiate agreements that extend principles internationally
- **Assistance**: Help other nations build capacity for human-centered AI governance
- **Standards**: Develop technical standards that embody democratic values
- **Example**: Show that democracy and technology can reinforce each other

Leadership is not imposition. America cannot force its values on others. But America can model effective governance, build coalitions of the willing, and create incentives for participation.

### Obstacles and Responses

Global convergence faces significant obstacles:

**Sovereignty concerns**: Nations resist external governance. Response: Federalism respects sovereignty while enabling coordination.

**Value differences**: Nations have different values. Response: Focus on shared interests (safety, stability) rather than values that divide.

**Power competition**: Great powers compete for advantage. Response: Find areas where competition is less acute; build trust incrementally.

**Enforcement problems**: International agreements are hard to enforce. Response: Use incentives rather than coercion; make non-participation costly.

**Speed mismatch**: AI advances faster than diplomacy. Response: Establish frameworks that can be updated quickly; delegate technical details to expert bodies.

**Institutional weakness**: International institutions are often ineffective. Response: Build new institutions or reform existing ones; start small and expand based on success.

None of these obstacles is insurmountable. All require sustained effort over decades.

---

### The Alternative

The alternative to global convergence is dangerous fragmentation:

**AI arms race**: Nations compete to develop AI fastest, regardless of safety
**Regulatory fragmentation**: Incompatible rules create compliance chaos
**Race to bottom**: Competition drives down standards everywhere
**Concentration**: A few nations or companies control AI, others are dependent
**Conflict**: AI-enabled warfare without restraint
**Catastrophe**: Misaligned AI harms humanity with no coordinated response

This is not speculation. It is the trajectory without coordination.

The choice is not between global governance and freedom. It is between coordinated response to shared challenges and uncoordinated descent into conflict and catastrophe.

### The Timeline

**2025-2030**: Foundation
- Human Standard implemented in America
- Bilateral agreements with key allies
- Trust-building through limited cooperation

**2030-2040**: Regional Integration
- Deep coordination within democratic regions
- Great power dialogues on mutual risks
- Emerging global standards

**2040-2050**: Global Framework
- Federated governance structures for global challenges
- Global AI Constitution adopted by major democracies
- Effective coordination on climate, pandemic, safety

**2050+**: Mature System
- Global cooperation is normal for shared challenges
- National sovereignty preserved for national matters
- Human-centered AI governance is the global standard

This timeline is ambitious. It requires sustained effort across administrations and generations. But the challenges require such effort.

---

### The Vision

The vision:

- A world where AI development is coordinated for human benefit
- Where truth can be verified across borders
- Where automation's benefits are shared globally
- Where shared challenges receive shared solutions
- Where democracy proves more effective than authoritarianism
- Where technology serves humanity everywhere

This is not utopia. Nations will still compete. Values will still differ. Problems will persist.

But within a framework of coordination, competition can be constructive rather than destructive. Differences can be managed rather than weaponized. Problems can be addressed rather than ignored.

Global convergence is the logical extension of the Human Standard. If technology should serve humanity, it should serve all of humanity.

The path is long. The work begins now.
