# Chapter 6
## Autonomous Everything

---

Mike Rowe has been driving trucks for twenty-three years. He started at nineteen, right out of high school, and never looked back. The open road, the independence, the decent pay without a college degree—it was a good life. A middle-class life.

Now he is fifty-two, and he reads the trade publications that discuss when his job will end.

"They keep saying five years," he told me. "They have been saying five years for ten years now. But this time feels different. The trucks I see testing on the highway—they are not just staying in their lane anymore. They are driving."

Mike is not a technology expert. He is a man who has spent two decades hauling freight across America. And he knows, with the certainty of someone who has watched his industry change, that the autonomous trucks are coming.

The question he asks is the same one millions of drivers are asking: what happens to us when they arrive?

### The 3.5 Million Question

Truck driving is one of the most common jobs in America. About 3.5 million people drive trucks for a living—long-haul truckers, delivery drivers, specialized haulers. Add the people who work at truck stops, motels, and diners that serve them, and the trucking ecosystem supports perhaps eight million jobs.

This is not a coastal, urban workforce that will adapt easily to new economy jobs. These are workers spread across America, often in rural areas, often without college degrees, often without obvious alternative employment.

When autonomous trucks arrive, what happens to these people?

The technology optimists say the transition will be gradual. Trucks will need human supervision for years. Drivers will become "truck monitors" who oversee the autonomous systems. New jobs will emerge in fleet management, remote supervision, and truck maintenance.

This is plausible. It is also insufficient.

Even if every long-haul driver becomes a supervisor, how many supervisors does the industry need? An autonomous truck can drive twenty hours per day; a human driver is limited to eleven. One autonomous truck replaces two human drivers just on operating hours alone.

And the economics are brutal. A human driver costs $70,000-$80,000 per year including benefits and payroll taxes. An autonomous truck has higher upfront costs but far lower operating costs—no wages, no benefits, no rest breaks, no human error causing accidents.

Within a decade of deployment, the economic pressure to remove humans from trucks will be overwhelming.

### The Technology Is Here

For years, autonomous trucking seemed perpetually five years away. Sensor costs were too high. The AI could not handle edge cases. Regulations lagged. The demonstrations impressed but deployment never materialized.

That is changing.

Aurora Innovation, the company founded by former leaders from Google's self-driving program, Tesla, and Uber, is running autonomous trucks on Texas highways. No safety driver. No human in the cab. Just a truck driving itself from terminal to terminal.

The trucks operate on specific routes under specific conditions—mostly highways, mostly good weather, mostly during the day. But they are operating. The freight they haul is real. The economic model is being proven.

TuSimple, despite corporate struggles, demonstrated fully autonomous coast-to-coast trucking in 2021. Embark, Kodiak, and others are running pilots across the American Southwest. Chinese companies like TuSimple's former partner Plus are testing aggressively.

The pattern is clear: autonomous trucks work on highways. The long-haul, interstate driving that accounts for most trucking miles can be automated with current technology. The edge cases remain—construction zones, accidents, severe weather—but these can be handled by having humans remotely monitor multiple trucks and intervene when needed.

What seemed impossible a decade ago now seems inevitable. The only question is how quickly deployment scales.

### The Deployment Timeline

Based on current progress and announced plans, here is a realistic deployment timeline:

**2025-2026: Limited Corridor Operations**

Autonomous trucks operate on specific highway corridors—Interstate 10 between Los Angeles and Phoenix, Interstate 45 between Dallas and Houston, and similar routes. Human drivers handle the first and last miles. Autonomous systems handle the long-haul middle.

The numbers are small—hundreds of trucks, specific customers, limited routes. But the proof of concept is established, and data accumulates.

**2027-2028: Regional Expansion**

Success on initial corridors leads to expansion. Major trucking companies—J.B. Hunt, Schneider, Werner—begin incorporating autonomous trucks into their fleets. The economic advantages are too significant to ignore.

Transfer hubs emerge at highway exits near major cities. Human drivers bring trailers to the hub. Autonomous trucks take them across the country. Human drivers pick them up at the destination hub.

The job of long-haul trucker begins to transform into the job of short-haul connector.

**2029-2030: Scale Deployment**

Autonomous trucks become standard for long-haul freight. Major carriers have converted significant portions of their fleets. The economics are proven—companies using autonomous trucks have substantial cost advantages over competitors who have not converted.

This creates a competitive imperative. Companies that cannot afford to convert lose business to those that can. The trucking industry consolidates around the firms with capital to invest in autonomy.

Long-haul trucking jobs decline rapidly. Some drivers transition to short-haul work. Many do not find comparable employment.

**2030s: Local Delivery**

Having conquered the highways, autonomous technology moves to local delivery. Trucks navigate city streets, make deliveries, handle the complex environments that were initially too challenging.

The last refuge of human drivers—local knowledge, customer relationships, the ability to handle unexpected situations—erodes as the technology improves.

### The Hidden Impacts

When 3.5 million trucking jobs disappear, the visible impact is obvious. The hidden impacts may be worse.

**Truck stops and roadside services**: An estimated 500,000 jobs exist at truck stops, motels, and diners that serve truckers. When trucks drive themselves, they do not need to stop for meals, rest, or showers. These businesses face devastating revenue loss.

**Small town economies**: Many small towns along interstate highways exist largely to serve trucking. The motel, the diner, the truck stop, the Walmart—all depend on trucker spending. When that spending disappears, what sustains these communities?

**Healthcare and aging**: Trucking is one of the few jobs that provides middle-class income without requiring college education. When these jobs disappear, workers must find alternatives. But truckers average 55 years old—too old to easily retrain, too young to retire. Many will face years of unemployment or underemployment before qualifying for Social Security.

**Geographic concentration**: The impact will hit certain regions hard. The Southeast and Midwest have disproportionate trucking employment. These are already the regions struggling most with economic transition. Autonomous trucking adds another blow.

### Beyond Trucks: The Autonomous World

Trucking is the most visible autonomous transformation, but it is not the only one. The same technology that drives trucks will drive everything.

**Delivery Vans and Last Mile**

Amazon, UPS, and FedEx are all investing heavily in autonomous delivery. The vehicles differ—vans, robots, drones—but the goal is identical: eliminate the human driver.

Amazon's delivery workforce exceeds 150,000. UPS employs over 125,000 drivers. These are not long-haul truckers; they are local delivery workers, often earning $20-30 per hour with benefits. When these jobs are automated, another million workers face displacement.

Nuro's small autonomous delivery pods are already operating in select markets. Sidewalk robots deliver food and packages on college campuses. Amazon's delivery drones are moving from test to deployment.

The technology exists. The deployment is expanding. The workforce impact is coming.

**Taxis and Ride-Sharing**

Waymo operates robotaxis in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. Cruise, despite setbacks, continues development. Tesla claims Full Self-Driving will enable robotaxi service.

Ride-sharing employs approximately 1.5 million drivers in the United States—many of them part-time, but for many it is primary income. When robotaxis are cheaper and safer than human drivers, what happens to these people?

The transformation will be uneven. Robotaxis will work first in carefully mapped cities with good weather. Complex urban environments and harsh climates will take longer. But the direction is clear, and the timeline is compressing.

**Public Transit**

Autonomous buses are already operating in controlled environments—airports, business parks, university campuses. The technology for public road deployment is developing rapidly.

Public transit systems face chronic driver shortages. Automation could solve this problem while reducing costs. For transit agencies running persistent deficits, the economic logic is compelling.

But transit driving is often a path to middle-class stability for workers without college degrees. These are exactly the workers who have the fewest alternatives when displaced.

**Aviation**

Cargo drones are already flying. Companies like Zipline deliver medical supplies in Africa. Amazon is developing delivery drones for consumer packages. Military drones have flown for decades.

The extension to passenger aviation is inevitable. First, cargo flights will become pilotless. Then private aviation. Then, eventually, commercial flights.

Aviation employs over 500,000 people in the United States as pilots, flight attendants, and ground crew. Many of these jobs will persist longer than trucking jobs—safety concerns and regulations will slow deployment. But the trajectory is the same.

**Maritime**

Container ships are already highly automated. A ship that once required a crew of forty now operates with fifteen. The extension to fully autonomous shipping is underway.

Rolls-Royce has developed autonomous ship technology. Maersk and other major shipping lines are testing self-navigating vessels. The economic logic is simple: crew costs are a major expense; eliminating them reduces costs significantly.

Port operations are also automating. Robotic cranes, automated guided vehicles, and AI-managed logistics are transforming what was once labor-intensive work.

### The Regulatory Question

Autonomous vehicles cannot deploy without regulatory approval. This creates a potential brake on transformation—but also a source of frustration and uneven development.

The federal government sets national standards for vehicle safety, but states control road usage. This creates a patchwork: Arizona welcomes autonomous testing, California imposes strict requirements, other states are uncertain.

The trucking industry is pushing for federal preemption—national standards that would override state restrictions. Their argument: a truck that drives from California to Texas cannot comply with fifty different regulatory regimes.

Consumer groups and safety advocates argue for caution. Autonomous vehicle accidents, though rare, generate intense media coverage. The public is uncertain—excited about the technology, nervous about its safety.

The regulatory debate will not stop autonomous vehicles. It will determine how quickly they deploy and where they deploy first. States that welcome autonomy will see economic benefits. States that resist will see their trucking industries move to more permissive jurisdictions.

Either way, the transformation is coming. Regulation determines the pace, not the destination.

### What We Learned From Manufacturing

The displacement of American manufacturing workers offers lessons for what is coming with autonomous vehicles.

The manufacturing collapse was not instant. It happened over decades, as factories closed gradually, as automation increased incrementally, as jobs were offshored one plant at a time. Each individual closure was a local story. The aggregate was a national catastrophe.

Politicians promised that displaced workers would retrain and find new jobs. Some did. Most did not. The government programs designed to help were underfunded, poorly designed, and insufficient to the scale of the challenge.

Communities that lost manufacturing never recovered. The opioid epidemic devastated exactly the regions that lost factory jobs. Deaths of despair—suicide, overdose, alcohol—correlated strongly with economic displacement. The social fabric frayed.

Autonomous vehicles threaten to repeat this pattern, but faster and broader. The trucking workforce is larger than manufacturing was at its displacement peak. The transformation will be faster—technology can scale more quickly than factory closures. The workers are older and less mobile than manufacturing workers were.

If we respond as we did to manufacturing automation—with inadequate programs, empty promises, and political neglect—the consequences will be worse.

### The Policy Imperative

The autonomous vehicle transformation cannot be stopped. It can be managed.

**Early warning systems**: The government should track autonomous vehicle deployment and project workforce impacts. Communities in the path of disruption need time to prepare.

**Transition support**: Workers displaced by autonomous vehicles need bridge income while they retrain or relocate. The Displaced Worker Emergency Fund proposed in this book would provide twelve months of support.

**Retraining that works**: Current job retraining programs have dismal success rates. New programs must be designed with automation in mind—training workers for jobs that will exist, not jobs that are also being automated.

**Regional economic development**: Communities dependent on trucking need alternative economic bases. Federal investment in infrastructure, renewable energy, and other industries can provide employment for displaced workers.

**Universal basic income**: As autonomous vehicles are one component of a broader automation wave, the ultimate solution is ensuring all citizens share in automation's productivity gains. Citizen's Royalty provides a floor beneath which no one falls.

The policy response must be proportional to the challenge. Autonomous vehicles will displace millions of workers over the next decade. Half-measures and empty promises are not sufficient.

### The Human Cost

Behind the statistics are people. Mike Rowe, the trucker who opened this chapter, has a mortgage, a wife, two kids in college. He has spent his entire adult life building skills that will soon be obsolete.

"I could learn to work on the trucks," he says. "The maintenance, the software. But they want young people for that. They want computer people. I am fifty-two and my back hurts from twenty years of loading docks."

He is not angry. He is resigned.

"Progress is progress," he says. "I have seen a lot of changes in trucking. Electronic logs, GPS tracking, all that. But this is different. This is the end of driving. Not the end of trucks—the end of drivers."

Mike is applying for jobs in local delivery. The pay is less, the benefits are worse, but it might last a few more years before those jobs are automated too.

"You do what you can," he says. "You take care of your family. But I worry about the young guys. What are they going to do? What is this country going to do with all the people who used to drive trucks?"

It is a question without an easy answer.

And it is coming whether we are ready or not.
