# Chapter 17
## The Yang—Embracing the Potential

---

Protection alone is not a vision. It is a response to threat. The Human Standard aims higher: not merely defending against automation's harms but seizing its opportunities.

AI and robotics could eliminate drudgery, extend healthy life, solve climate change, expand human creativity, and create abundance beyond historical imagination. These possibilities are not guaranteed—they require deliberate pursuit. But they are possible.

This chapter presents the yang: policies that help humanity flourish in the automation age, that capture technology's promise rather than merely mitigating its peril.

### Innovation Acceleration

If AI is coming regardless, America should lead its development—shaping its direction and capturing its benefits.

---

#### 1. National AI Research Institute

**The Problem**: AI development concentrates in a handful of private companies with commercial priorities. Public interest research is underfunded.

**The Solution**: Major federal investment in public AI research.

**Structure**:

- $50 billion federal investment over ten years
- Network of university-based research centers
- Focus areas: beneficial applications (healthcare, climate, education), safety and alignment, economic impact
- Open publication requirements (contrast with proprietary corporate research)
- Talent pipeline: fellowships, scholarships, faculty positions

**Priorities**:

- Healthcare AI: Diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, personalized medicine
- Climate AI: Grid optimization, materials discovery, carbon capture
- Education AI: Adaptive learning, accessibility, translation
- Safety research: Alignment, robustness, interpretability

**Why This Matters**: Public research serves public interests. Without federal investment, AI development is entirely shaped by commercial imperatives. The National AI Research Institute ensures some AI development prioritizes human welfare.

---

#### 2. Automation Dividend Fund

**The Problem**: Productivity gains from automation flow to capital owners. Citizens do not share directly in technological progress.

**The Solution**: Direct distribution of automation's productivity gains.

**Design**:

- Portion of automation tax revenue deposited in Automation Dividend Fund
- Fund invests in diversified portfolio including AI companies
- Returns distributed annually to all citizens as Automation Dividend
- Dividend grows as automation accelerates

**Mechanism**:

- Initial distribution: ~$500/year per citizen
- As automation accelerates: $1,000-2,000/year projected
- Combined with Citizen's Royalty, provides substantial income floor

**Why This Matters**: The Automation Dividend makes every American a beneficiary of technological progress. When AI creates wealth, citizens share in it directly.

---

#### 3. Open Source AI Initiative

**The Problem**: AI development concentrates power in a few companies. Proprietary models cannot be audited, studied, or democratically controlled.

**The Solution**: Support open-source AI development.

**Provisions**:

- Federal funding for open-source AI projects
- Government procurement preferences for open-source AI
- Tax incentives for companies that release models openly
- National Open Source AI Repository: curated, secure, publicly accessible

**Rationale**:

- Open source enables auditing for bias and safety
- Open source prevents monopolistic control
- Open source allows smaller companies and researchers to build on shared foundation
- Open source creates public infrastructure rather than private tollgates

**Why This Matters**: The choice between proprietary and open AI is partly a choice between concentrated and distributed power. Open source AI serves democratic values.

---

#### 4. AI-Human Collaboration Incentives

**The Problem**: The economic incentive is to replace workers with AI. Augmentation that preserves jobs is undervalued.

**The Solution**: Create countervailing incentives for human-AI collaboration.

**Tax Credits**:

- Credit for AI deployments that augment rather than replace workers
- Credit for maintaining employment levels while implementing AI
- Credit for human-in-the-loop systems that preserve human oversight
- Credit calculated as percentage of AI investment, conditional on employment effects

**Recognition**:

- Federal "Human-Centered AI" certification for exemplary companies
- Preference in federal contracting for certified companies
- Public recognition and best practice sharing

**Why This Matters**: Markets currently optimize for labor cost reduction. These incentives create economic reason to optimize for human-AI collaboration instead.

---

### Human Potential Policies

Even as AI handles more tasks, human capabilities must be developed and valued.

---

#### 5. Lifelong Learning Accounts

**The Problem**: Education is front-loaded—concentrated in youth—while career spans decades of change. Workers cannot afford continuous education.

**The Solution**: Universal accounts for lifelong learning.

**Design**:

- $10,000 initial deposit per citizen at age 18
- Annual federal contribution of $500
- Employer contributions tax-advantaged
- Usable for: accredited education, vocational training, professional development, credentialing
- Unused balances roll over and grow

**Portability**:

- Accounts owned by individuals, not employers
- Usable at any age
- Applicable to any approved program
- Balance survives job changes and career transitions

**Why This Matters**: The economy of continuous change requires continuous learning. Lifelong Learning Accounts make ongoing education financially viable for everyone.

---

#### 6. Creative Economy Support

**The Problem**: AI can produce serviceable content—text, images, music—at marginal cost. Human artists face price competition they cannot win.

**The Solution**: Support human creativity through public investment and market differentiation.

**Public Investment**:

- Expanded NEA/NEH funding: 10x increase from current levels
- Artist residencies and fellowships
- Public art commissions
- Arts education in schools

**Market Differentiation**:

- "Human Made" certification and labeling
- Consumer education about human vs. AI content
- Disclosure requirements for AI-generated commercial content
- Premium positioning for authentic human work

**Why This Matters**: Creativity is among the most human of activities. Even if AI can produce competent work, human creativity has intrinsic value worth preserving and celebrating.

---

#### 7. Care Economy Investment

**The Problem**: Care work—childcare, eldercare, disability care—is undervalued despite being essential and irreducibly human.

**The Solution**: Professionalize and compensate care work appropriately.

**Provisions**:

- Federal wage standards for care workers: living wage floor
- Benefits requirements: healthcare, retirement, paid leave for care workers
- Training and credentialing programs with federal support
- Career pathways: entry-level to advanced care positions

**Recognition**:

- Care work counts toward Social Security and retirement
- Unpaid family caregivers eligible for Caregiver Credits
- Public awareness campaigns on care work value

**Why This Matters**: As AI takes over information work, care work becomes the paradigmatic human occupation. Investment in the care economy creates dignified work that AI cannot do.

---

#### 8. Entrepreneurship for All

**The Problem**: Starting a business requires capital, connections, and risk tolerance that most people lack.

**The Solution**: Reduce barriers to entrepreneurship.

**Universal Business Formation Support**:

- Free business registration and licensing
- Template legal documents for common business structures
- Small business banking access guarantees
- Simplified tax compliance for small enterprises

**Micro-Lending Expansion**:

- Federal micro-loan fund for small business starts
- Loans up to $50,000 with favorable terms
- No collateral requirements for smallest loans
- Technical assistance bundled with financing

**Risk Reduction**:

- Citizen's Royalty provides baseline during startup phase
- Portable benefits eliminate insurance dependency on employment
- Bankruptcy reform for failed entrepreneurs

**Why This Matters**: Entrepreneurship enables people to create their own work rather than depending on employers. In the automation age, self-employment and small business ownership may be increasingly important paths to livelihood.

---

### Governance Innovation

The automation age requires governance structures that match technological reality.

---

#### 9. Algorithmic Governance Standards

**The Problem**: Government already uses AI for decisions about benefits, enforcement, and services—often without transparency or accountability.

**The Solution**: Establish standards for fair AI in government.

**Requirements**:

- All government AI systems must be auditable
- Decisions affecting individuals must be explainable
- Bias testing required before deployment
- Human override always available
- Regular review of system performance

**Transparency**:

- Public registry of government AI systems
- Published audit results
- Clear indication when AI influenced a decision
- Accessible appeal processes

**Prohibited Uses**:

- No predictive policing without judicial oversight
- No social credit scoring
- No emotion recognition in government facilities
- No AI-only decision-making for life-altering determinations

**Why This Matters**: Government AI serves citizens. It must be accountable, transparent, and fair—higher standards than we might apply to private AI.

---

#### 10. Automation-Aware Budgeting

**The Problem**: Federal budget projections assume employment patterns that automation is changing. Tax revenue and program costs will diverge from projections.

**The Solution**: Integrate automation impact into fiscal planning.

**Requirements**:

- CBO must model automation effects on employment, wages, and tax revenue
- Budget projections must include automation scenarios
- Program costs must account for likely enrollment changes
- Long-term fiscal plans must address automation-driven changes

**Automation Impact Assessment**:

- Major legislation reviewed for automation interaction
- Tax changes assessed for automation effects
- Program changes evaluated for automation responsiveness

**Why This Matters**: Governing in the automation age requires seeing automation. Budget processes that ignore technological change will produce surprised policymakers and inadequate responses.

---

### Blockchain and Monetary Freedom

The truth infrastructure and purchasing power stability options described in Chapter 9 are also opportunity policies—giving citizens tools for verification and financial autonomy.

---

#### 11. National Authenticity Infrastructure

The deepfake crisis threatens shared truth. The opportunity is infrastructure that makes verification routine.

**Investment**: $500 million federal R&D in verification technology

**Standards**: Federal government leads by blockchain-verifying all official communications

**Integration**: Legal evidentiary status for blockchain-verified content

---

#### 12. Blockchain Voting Option

The opportunity: voting systems that are both secure and verifiable.

**Pilot programs** for overseas military and accessibility cases

**Federal grants** for states implementing blockchain voting

**Zero-knowledge proofs** for ballot secrecy with verification

**Paper backup** maintained throughout transition

---

#### 13. Self-Sovereign Digital Identity

The opportunity: citizens control their own digital identity.

**Voluntary blockchain-based national digital ID**

**Selective disclosure**: share only what is necessary

**Integration with government services**

**Privacy protections**: no central surveillance database

---

#### 14. Sound Money Transition Framework

The opportunity: money that cannot be debased.

**Bitcoin and approved crypto as legal tender** (voluntary acceptance)

**No capital gains tax** on crypto purchases under $10,000

**Sound Money Savings Accounts**: tax-advantaged Bitcoin holdings

**Diversified Strategic Reserve expansion**: target 1 million BTC

---

#### 15. Stablecoin Standards

The opportunity: dollar stability without surveillance.

**100% reserve requirements** for approved stablecoins

**American Digital Dollar (ADD)**: private, regulated, privacy-preserving

**Consumer protections and redemption guarantees**

**Alternative to surveillance-enabling CBDCs**

---

#### 16. Gradual Dollar Transition

The opportunity: let citizens choose their money.

**Government accepts crypto for taxes and fees**

**Optional crypto payment for federal benefits**

**Citizen's Royalty payments available in stablecoin** (citizen choice)

**20-year voluntary transition timeline**

**Dollar remains option**: market determines winner

---

### The Opportunity Framework

The yang policies form a coherent framework of opportunity:

**Innovation**: Public AI research, open source development, collaboration incentives—shaping AI toward human benefit

**Dividend**: Direct distribution of automation gains through funds and payments

**Learning**: Lifelong Learning Accounts enabling continuous adaptation

**Creativity**: Support for human artistry and cultural production

**Care**: Investment in irreducibly human work

**Enterprise**: Reduced barriers to entrepreneurship and self-employment

**Governance**: Standards ensuring public AI serves citizens

**Planning**: Budget processes that account for automation

**Truth**: Infrastructure for verification in the deepfake age

**Money**: Purchasing power stability options and financial autonomy

Together with the protective policies, these create a comprehensive framework for human flourishing in the automation age.

---

### The Balance

Yin and yang are not opposites but complements. Protection without opportunity is mere defense against change. Opportunity without protection leaves casualties. The Human Standard integrates both.

The protective policies ensure no one is crushed by automation's wheels. The opportunity policies ensure everyone can ride its engine.

This is the full policy framework of The Human Standard:

- See the change (disclosure)
- Cushion the fall (emergency support)
- Guarantee the basics (human service rights, Citizen's Royalty, UBS)
- Share the gains (automation tax, data dividend, sovereign wealth fund)
- Distribute the work (work week reduction)
- Build the future (research, open source, collaboration)
- Invest in humans (learning, creativity, care)
- Enable enterprise (entrepreneurship support)
- Govern wisely (algorithmic standards, automation-aware budgeting)
- Verify truth (blockchain infrastructure)
- Offer choice (purchasing power stability options)

This is not a complete answer to every question the automation age will raise. But it is a framework robust enough to adapt, comprehensive enough to address major challenges, and grounded enough in human values to maintain its direction.

Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around.
