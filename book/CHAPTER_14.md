## The Yang Prescription

---

In 2019, a businessman nobody had heard of ran for president on a single idea: give every American adult $1,000 per month, no strings attached.

Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend seemed absurd at first. Where would the money come from? Wouldn't people stop working? Wasn't this just socialism with better branding?

But something remarkable happened. The idea caught fire. Yang qualified for the debates. He built a passionate following—the "Yang Gang"—that included libertarians and progressives, tech workers and truck drivers. His polling never reached the top tier, but his ideas entered the mainstream.

Four years later, universal basic income is no longer a fringe concept. Pilot programs have launched across America and around the world. Mayors and governors advocate for it. Academic research has accumulated. The idea that once seemed radical now seems increasingly inevitable.

Andrew Yang was not the first person to propose Citizen's Royalty. But he brought it to the center of American political discourse at exactly the moment automation made it necessary.

He was early. But he was not wrong.

### What Is Universal Basic Income?

Universal Basic Income is exactly what it sounds like:

**Universal**: Everyone gets it. No means testing, no eligibility requirements, no bureaucratic determination of who deserves help. Every citizen, every month.

**Basic**: Enough to survive on, not enough to live luxuriously. The amount is a floor beneath which no one falls, not a ceiling that eliminates the incentive to work.

**Income**: Cash, not services. Recipients decide how to spend it. Government does not dictate whether you buy food or fix your car—you choose based on your actual needs.

Yang's Freedom Dividend proposed $1,000 per month—$12,000 per year—for every American adult. This would not make anyone rich, but it would eliminate absolute poverty. It would provide a cushion that allows people to take risks, leave abusive situations, start businesses, care for family members, and make choices that poverty forecloses.

The simplicity is the point. Current social programs are complicated—different eligibility rules, different application processes, different bureaucracies. Many people who qualify for benefits do not receive them because the systems are too difficult to navigate.

Citizen's Royalty eliminates this complexity. If you are a citizen, you get the money. Period.

### The History of the Idea

Citizen's Royalty is not new. The concept has a long and surprising history across the political spectrum.

**Thomas Paine**, one of America's founders, proposed in 1797 that every citizen receive a payment from a national fund at age 21, plus annual payments thereafter. This was to compensate for the loss of natural inheritance when land was privatized.

**Milton Friedman**, the conservative economist, advocated for a negative income tax—functionally similar to Citizen's Royalty. He saw it as more efficient than the patchwork of welfare programs, eliminating bureaucracy while providing support.

**Martin Luther King Jr.** called for a guaranteed income in his final book: "I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective—the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a guaranteed income."

**Richard Nixon** nearly implemented a guaranteed income. His Family Assistance Plan passed the House in 1970 and 1971 but died in the Senate. The policy came remarkably close to becoming law.

The idea spans left and right because it addresses concerns on both sides: security and dignity for progressives, simplicity and efficiency for conservatives. It respects individual choice rather than dictating how people should live.

### The Alaska Model

Universal basic income is not just theory. It has operated successfully in Alaska for over forty years.

The Alaska Permanent Fund was established in 1976, investing a portion of oil revenues in a fund whose earnings are distributed annually to every Alaska resident. The dividend varies based on investment returns, ranging from about $1,000 to $2,000 per year per person.

This is not quite Citizen's Royalty—the amount is modest and varies—but it demonstrates key principles:

**Universal distribution works**: Every Alaskan receives a check. The logistics are manageable. The system functions.

**It is wildly popular**: The Permanent Fund dividend is politically untouchable. Republicans and Democrats alike support it. Proposals to reduce it face overwhelming opposition.

**It reduces poverty**: Research shows the dividend reduces poverty rates, particularly among Alaska Natives and rural communities.

**It does not eliminate work**: Alaskans work at rates similar to other states. The dividend provides a floor, not a replacement for earned income.

**It creates a sense of ownership**: Alaskans feel they are sharing in the state's resource wealth. This builds support for the program and creates political resistance to its elimination.

The Alaska model proves that unconditional cash distribution is administratively feasible, politically sustainable, and socially beneficial. The question is whether it can scale to the nation.

### The Global Experiments

Beyond Alaska, Citizen's Royalty experiments have proliferated worldwide:

**Finland (2017-2018)**: 2,000 unemployed citizens received €560 monthly with no conditions. Results: recipients were happier, healthier, and more trusting of institutions. Employment effects were minimal—they worked about as much as the control group.

**Kenya (GiveDirectly, 2016-present)**: Over 20,000 people receive unconditional cash transfers in a twelve-year experiment. Early results: increased consumption, business investment, and asset ownership. No increase in "temptation goods" like alcohol.

**Stockton, California (2019-2021)**: 125 residents received $500 monthly. Results: recipients increased full-time employment (from 28% to 40%), reduced income volatility, and reported improved wellbeing. The money went to food, utilities, and auto expenses—not frivolous spending.

**India (Madhya Pradesh, 2011-2012)**: 6,000 villagers received modest cash transfers. Results: improved nutrition, school attendance, and economic activity. Women particularly benefited, gaining financial autonomy.

**Namibia (2008-2009)**: A village received universal grants for two years. Results: reduced poverty, improved nutrition, increased school attendance, and startup of small businesses.

The evidence consistently shows:

- Cash transfers work. Recipients spend money on necessities, not vices.
- Work does not decrease dramatically. People continue working for additional income, meaning, and social connection.
- Wellbeing improves. Mental health, physical health, and life satisfaction increase.
- The money circulates. Local economies benefit as recipients spend in their communities.

The experiments are limited—small scale, short duration, specific contexts. They do not prove that national Citizen's Royalty would work identically. But they provide strong evidence that the concept is sound.

### The Yang Approach

Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend had specific features worth examining:

**$1,000 per month**: High enough to matter, low enough to be fiscally plausible and to maintain work incentives.

**Opt-in replacement**: Recipients could choose the Freedom Dividend or existing benefits, not both for most programs. This avoids "stacking" concerns while protecting those whose current benefits exceed $1,000.

**Value-Added Tax funding**: A 10% VAT on goods and services would raise substantial revenue while ensuring that large corporations—especially tech companies—contribute.

**Legal status only**: Citizens and legal permanent residents only. This avoided contentious immigration debates.

The specific numbers and mechanisms are debatable. Different proposals have different structures. But Yang's approach demonstrated that Citizen's Royalty can be designed to be fiscally responsible while achieving its goals.

### The Economics

Can we afford Citizen's Royalty? The math is daunting but not impossible.

**The cost**: 250 million adults × $12,000/year = $3 trillion annually. This is a staggering sum—roughly the entire federal budget.

**The offsets**: Much of this cost is not actually new spending:

- Existing programs (Social Security, SNAP, SSI, etc.) partially offset Citizen's Royalty costs for recipients who opt in to the new system
- Economic growth from the stimulus effect of Citizen's Royalty generates tax revenue
- The VAT that funds Citizen's Royalty recovers a portion of distributed funds through taxation
- Reduced costs for poverty-related services (emergency rooms, incarceration, social services) provide savings

**The funding mechanisms**: Various combinations can work:

- Value-Added Tax (10% raises ~$1 trillion)
- Carbon tax (provides revenue while addressing climate)
- Financial transactions tax (raises hundreds of billions)
- Automation tax (ties funding to the displacement problem)
- Wealth tax or increased capital gains taxation
- Sovereign wealth fund returns over time

The numbers require careful analysis beyond this chapter's scope. But several points are clear:

First, Citizen's Royalty would represent a massive fiscal undertaking—the largest social program in American history. This is a feature, not a bug. The automation challenge is massive; the response must match.

Second, "can we afford it" is the wrong question. The right question is "can we afford not to?" If automation displaces tens of millions of workers, the costs of not responding—lost consumption, social services, political instability—are also enormous.

Third, Citizen's Royalty is ultimately a redistribution, not a cost. The money does not disappear; it flows from where it accumulates (capital, automation gains) to where it is spent (consumption). The aggregate economy is not impoverished; resources are reallocated.

### The Inflation Concern

The most common economic objection: won't giving everyone money just cause prices to rise, erasing the benefit?

This concern reflects reasonable intuition but misunderstands the mechanism:

**Citizen's Royalty is not money creation**: Unlike quantitative easing or deficit spending, Citizen's Royalty funded by taxes does not expand the money supply. It moves existing money from one pocket (corporate profits, high earners) to another (citizens). Redistribution is not inherently inflationary.

**Supply is not constrained**: Inflation occurs when demand exceeds supply. For most consumer goods, production can scale to meet increased demand. The constraint is usually purchasing power, not productive capacity.

**The marginal propensity to consume**: Lower-income people spend a higher percentage of additional income. When money flows to them, it circulates through the economy rather than sitting in financial assets. This is stimulative, but stimulus is not the same as inflation.

**The evidence**: The experiments described above did not show significant inflation effects. The Alaska dividend has not caused Alaska prices to spiral.

Some price increases for scarce goods—housing in supply-constrained markets, for example—might occur. But this argues for complementary policies (housing construction, zoning reform) rather than against Citizen's Royalty itself.

### The Work Incentive Concern

The second-most-common objection: won't people stop working?

The concern is not unreasonable. Economic theory suggests that providing income without work reduces work incentive. But the concern is overstated:

**$12,000 is not enough**: The Freedom Dividend provides subsistence, not comfort. Most people want more than subsistence. The incentive to work for additional income remains strong.

**Work is not just about money**: People work for meaning, social connection, structure, and identity. Survey data consistently shows that most people would continue working even if they did not need the money.

**The evidence**: The experiments show minimal employment reduction. Some workers reduce hours—particularly caregivers—but most continue working. The fear of mass workforce exit is not supported by data.

**Some work reduction is good**: If some people reduce work to care for children, pursue education, start businesses, or address health issues, this may be socially beneficial. The concern assumes all work is equally valuable and any reduction is harmful.

**The alternative is worse**: If automation eliminates jobs, the alternative to Citizen's Royalty is not employment—it is unemployment without support. The question is not "Citizen's Royalty vs. work" but "Citizen's Royalty vs. poverty."

### Beyond Citizen's Royalty: Related Proposals

Citizen's Royalty is not the only approach to ensuring income security in the automation age. Related proposals include:

**Negative Income Tax**: Instead of giving everyone $12,000 and taxing it back from high earners, simply adjust tax brackets so low earners receive payments. Milton Friedman's preferred approach. Mechanically similar to Citizen's Royalty, but implemented through tax code.

**Job Guarantee**: The government provides employment for anyone who wants it at a living wage. This preserves the dignity of work while ensuring income. Critics question whether the jobs would be meaningful and whether the program could be administered effectively.

**Universal Basic Services**: Instead of cash, provide services universally—healthcare, education, transportation, housing. This ensures basic needs are met while preserving incentives for cash income.

**Wage subsidies**: Supplement low wages through government payments. Essentially Citizen's Royalty for workers only. The Earned Income Tax Credit is a version of this.

**Shortened work week**: Reduce standard hours to spread available work across more workers. If productivity allows the same output in fewer hours, work less rather than employing fewer people.

These approaches are not mutually exclusive. A comprehensive response to automation might combine elements: Citizen's Royalty as a floor, universal services for basic needs, job guarantees for those who want to work, shortened work weeks to spread employment.

The Human Standard centers on Citizen's Royalty but embraces complementary approaches.

### The Political Path

Yang's campaign demonstrated that Citizen's Royalty can attract support across traditional political divides. But passing it requires navigating political obstacles:

**Progressive support**: Many progressives support Citizen's Royalty but worry it might replace rather than complement existing programs. They want guarantees that vulnerable populations will not be worse off. The opt-in structure addresses this concern.

**Conservative support**: Some conservatives support Citizen's Royalty's simplicity and efficiency but resist the tax increases required. Framing Citizen's Royalty as a replacement for bureaucratic programs, combined with funding from automation rather than income taxes, can expand conservative support.

**Business support**: Tech executives have shown surprising openness to Citizen's Royalty, recognizing that automation creates the need for it. Their support can be valuable but also creates suspicion that Citizen's Royalty is cover for unaccountable automation.

**Labor support**: Unions have been ambivalent—supporting income security but skeptical of programs that might reduce pressure for job creation. Emphasizing Citizen's Royalty as a floor that strengthens workers' bargaining power can build union support.

**General public support**: Polls show increasing support for Citizen's Royalty, especially among young people. The pandemic—which briefly implemented something like Citizen's Royalty through stimulus payments—demonstrated both feasibility and value.

Building a coalition requires meeting different groups' concerns while maintaining the core design: universal, unconditional, cash.

### The Human Standard Approach

The Human Standard proposes Citizen's Royalty as follows:

**Phase 1 (2025-2027)**: Pilot programs in regions facing acute automation displacement. $500/month to start. Rigorous evaluation of effects.

**Phase 2 (2027-2030)**: Expand to national eligibility with income-based phase-in. Lower income receives full Citizen's Royalty; higher income receives reduced amount.

**Phase 3 (2030+)**: Full implementation with NIT floor of $24,000-30,000/year as automation accelerates. Funding primarily from automation taxes and data dividends.

The amounts are adjustable based on research and political feasibility. The key principles are:

- Universal eligibility
- Unconditional receipt
- Sufficient to provide genuine security
- Funded by productivity gains from automation

This is Andrew Yang's prescription, refined and developed for the realities of the 2020s. He was early. The time is now.
