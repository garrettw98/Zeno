## Agency-Centered Capitalism as Operating System

---

Andrew Yang popularized the term during his 2020 presidential campaign: Agency-Centered Capitalism. The phrase captures a fundamental reorientation—from an economy that treats humans as inputs to one that treats humans as the point.

"Humans are more important than money," Yang would say. "Markets exist to serve our common goals and values." Simple statements that sound obvious until you examine how our current systems actually work.

GDP grows while median wages stagnate. Stock markets boom while communities decay. Corporate profits surge while families struggle. The economy, by its own metrics, succeeds. By human metrics, it increasingly fails.

Agency-Centered Capitalism proposes different metrics, different goals, different measures of success. It does not reject capitalism—markets, property, incentives remain. But it insists that capitalism serve human flourishing rather than demanding that humans serve capitalism.

For The Human Standard, Agency-Centered Capitalism becomes the operating system—the foundational logic that governs how AI administration actually functions. The AI must optimize for something. What it optimizes for determines everything else.

### Beyond GDP

The critique of GDP as our primary economic metric is now familiar:

GDP measures activity, not wellbeing. A car accident increases GDP—hospital bills, repairs, legal fees. A disease increases GDP—medical spending. Divorce increases GDP—lawyers, realtors, therapists. GDP rises as bad things happen.

GDP ignores distribution. An economy where one person has everything and everyone else has nothing can have high GDP. The metric says nothing about whether prosperity is shared.

GDP misses what matters most. Parenting, caregiving, volunteering, community building—none appear in GDP. The things that make life meaningful are economically invisible.

GDP incentivizes the wrong things. Maximizing GDP means maximizing activity, regardless of whether that activity serves human needs. Environmental destruction increases GDP. Planned obsolescence increases GDP. Addiction increases GDP.

These critiques are decades old. Yet GDP remains the dominant metric, shaping policy, driving politics, defining success. Why?

Partly because GDP is measurable. It can be calculated, compared, tracked over time. Alternative metrics are harder to define and measure.

Partly because powerful interests benefit from GDP focus. Corporations care about GDP because it correlates with their revenue. Politicians care because GDP growth helps them get reelected. The metric serves those who already have power.

Partly because we have not built alternatives. Critiquing GDP is easy; replacing it is hard. The Human Standard proposes a replacement.

### The Human-Centered Metrics

Agency-Centered Capitalism measures what matters:

**Health**
- Life expectancy at birth
- Healthy life years (not just years, but quality years)
- Mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, suicide rates)
- Childhood health metrics (nutrition, development, chronic illness)
- Preventable deaths

**Economic Security**
- Median household income (not average, which billionaires skew)
- Poverty rate
- Housing affordability (cost as percentage of income)
- Healthcare affordability
- Household debt levels
- Financial emergency capacity (can a family cover a $400 emergency?)

**Freedom**
- Civil liberties index
- Press freedom
- Democratic participation (voter turnout, civic engagement)
- Geographic mobility
- Entrepreneurship rates
- Economic mobility (can children do better than parents?)

**Environment**
- Air quality (particulate matter, ozone)
- Water quality
- Biodiversity indices
- Carbon emissions
- Sustainability metrics
- Climate resilience

**Social Cohesion**
- Trust in institutions
- Trust in each other (social capital)
- Community engagement
- Family stability
- Crime rates and public safety
- Polarization measures

**Opportunity**
- Educational attainment
- Skills development
- Career advancement potential
- Access to capital for entrepreneurship
- Innovation metrics

These categories can be measured. Data exists for most indicators. The challenge is not measurement but priority—making these metrics matter as much as GDP.

### The Human-Centered GDP

The Human Standard proposes an annual "Human-Centered GDP" report alongside traditional GDP.

The report would:

- Track each metric category over time
- Compare current year to previous years
- Compare United States to peer nations
- Identify areas of improvement and concern
- Connect policies to outcomes

The report would be prepared by an independent agency, insulated from political pressure—similar to how the Bureau of Labor Statistics operates.

The goal is not to replace GDP entirely but to supplement it. When politicians and media discuss the economy, they should discuss both: "GDP grew 2.3% this year, but the Human-Centered metrics show declining mental health, stagnant median wages, and falling trust in institutions."

Over time, the Human-Centered GDP would become the primary reference. Citizens would judge politicians on human-centered performance. Markets would price in human-centered factors. The metrics would shape behavior because they shape what we pay attention to.

### AI Optimization

Here is where Agency-Centered Capitalism becomes operational: government AI systems must optimize for human-centered metrics, not GDP.

This is not abstract. AI systems optimize for whatever objective function they are given. If we tell AI to maximize GDP, it will find ways to maximize GDP—even if those ways harm human wellbeing. If we tell AI to maximize human flourishing, it will find ways to do that instead.

Consider a few examples:

**Benefits administration**: Current systems often optimize for minimizing costs—denying benefits wherever possible, creating barriers to enrollment, making programs hard to access. Human-Centered AI would optimize for ensuring eligible people receive benefits—reducing barriers, increasing enrollment, measuring success by wellbeing outcomes rather than budget savings.

**Procurement**: Current systems often optimize for lowest cost, leading to lowest quality. Human-Centered AI would optimize for value—considering worker treatment, environmental impact, community effects, not just price.

**Tax policy**: Current systems optimize for revenue or for economic activity (GDP). Human-Centered AI would optimize for economic security—ensuring tax burdens are distributed fairly and revenues fund programs that improve wellbeing metrics.

**Regulation**: Current systems often optimize for compliance simplicity or for regulated industry preferences (regulatory capture). Human-Centered AI would optimize for the goals regulation serves—clean air, safe products, fair markets—measuring success by outcomes rather than process.

The AI Policy Council, described in the next chapters, translates democratic priorities into optimization targets. Citizens, through representatives, decide what we value. AI determines how to achieve it. The Human-Centered metrics provide the shared language for these conversations.

### The Inviolable Constraints

Human-Centered optimization operates within absolute constraints—the Five Laws that cannot be violated regardless of optimization goals:

**1. Do No Harm**

No policy implemented by AI may directly cause physical harm to citizens or deprive them of basic necessities. This is absolute—not "minimize harm" or "balance harm against benefit" but "do no harm."

What this means in practice:
- Benefits cannot be cut in ways that leave people without food, housing, or medical care
- Enforcement actions cannot cause physical danger
- Policy experiments cannot use citizens as unwilling subjects

**2. Maximize Flourishing**

Optimize for human wellbeing, not GDP or corporate profit. When tradeoffs arise, human wellbeing takes priority.

What this means in practice:
- Economic policy serves people, not the reverse
- Corporate interests do not override citizen interests
- Long-term human outcomes matter more than short-term economic metrics

**3. Preserve Agency**

Humans retain ultimate control. Every AI decision can be overridden by appropriate human authority. Citizens can always request human review.

What this means in practice:
- The AI recommends; humans can reject
- No AI-only decisions for life-altering matters
- Kill switches exist and work

**4. Maintain Transparency**

Civilian government AI systems are open source under the Tiered Transparency Framework and auditable. No black boxes. Citizens can understand why decisions were made.

What this means in practice:
- Published code for all AI systems
- Explained decisions with clear reasoning
- Regular audits by independent reviewers

**5. Serve All Equally**

No discrimination based on protected characteristics. No special treatment for the wealthy or connected. Equal application of rules to all.

What this means in practice:
- Same rules for billionaires and minimum wage workers
- No favoritism in benefits, procurement, or enforcement
- Regular testing for discriminatory patterns

These constraints are built into the AI systems themselves—not policies that can be changed but architectures that cannot be violated.

### Markets Within Boundaries

Agency-Centered Capitalism is not socialism. Markets continue operating. Private property is protected. Incentives motivate effort and innovation. The differences are in goals and constraints.

**Goals**: The economy serves human flourishing, measured by Human-Centered metrics. Growth is good when it improves wellbeing; growth that harms wellbeing is failure, not success.

**Constraints**: Markets operate within boundaries set by democratic process. Some activities are prohibited (environmental destruction beyond limits). Some are required (minimum wages, benefits). Some are taxed to fund public goods. Markets are powerful tools; tools serve purposes.

**Distribution**: Market outcomes are not sacred. If markets concentrate wealth in ways that harm human flourishing, redistribution is appropriate. The automation dividend, Citizen's Royalty, and progressive taxation are not punishments for success but mechanisms for ensuring prosperity is shared.

**Competition**: Markets work when competition works. Monopoly and concentration undermine market benefits. Antitrust enforcement and open-source requirements maintain competitive markets.

This is not a new idea. It is the recognition that markets are means, not ends—that economic systems exist to serve human purposes, not to be served by humans.

### The Historical Parallel

Agency-Centered Capitalism has precedent in the post-war consensus that built the American middle class.

From 1945 to 1975, American capitalism operated differently:

- Progressive taxation limited extreme wealth accumulation
- Strong unions ensured workers shared in productivity gains
- Regulation protected consumers and the environment
- Social programs provided security against hardship
- Infrastructure investment built shared prosperity

The result was broad-based growth. Productivity gains flowed to workers. The middle class expanded. Economic security was normal, not exceptional.

This consensus broke down starting in the 1970s. Tax cuts favored wealth accumulation. Unions weakened. Regulation retreated. Social programs were cut. The economy was reoriented around maximizing returns to capital rather than broadly shared prosperity.

Agency-Centered Capitalism proposes a new consensus appropriate to the automation age. Not a return to 1955—technology and society have changed—but a recovery of the principle that economic systems should serve human flourishing.

### Implementation

Agency-Centered Capitalism is not just a philosophy. It is a set of operational changes:

**Metric publication**: Annual Human-Centered GDP report from independent agency. Required consideration in all major policy decisions.

**AI objective functions**: Government AI systems optimize for human-centered metrics, subject to Five Laws constraints.

**Policy evaluation**: Programs evaluated by human-centered outcomes, not just cost or activity metrics.

**Budget priorities**: Resource allocation guided by human-centered priorities, not just GDP contribution.

**Regulatory focus**: Regulations judged by human welfare effects, not just compliance costs.

**International comparison**: Benchmark against nations that score well on human-centered metrics, not just GDP.

The changes are substantial but implementable. They do not require revolutionary transformation—just consistent application of the principle that humans matter more than numbers.

### The Vision

Imagine an America where:

- Success is measured by whether people are healthier, more secure, more free
- Economic growth that harms wellbeing is recognized as failure
- Every citizen knows how their community ranks on human-centered metrics
- Politicians compete on who can best improve human flourishing
- AI systems relentlessly optimize for what actually matters to people

This is Agency-Centered Capitalism in operation. It is not utopia—problems remain, tradeoffs persist, perfection is impossible. But it is an economy oriented toward the right goals, measured by the right metrics, governed by the right constraints.

Technology serves humanity. Not the other way around.

The Human Standard makes this operational. Agency-Centered Capitalism provides the foundation.
