## The Yin—Protecting Against the Downsides

---

Every transformative technology brings both promise and peril. The automobile created freedom and mobility; it also created pollution and traffic deaths. The internet connected humanity; it also enabled surveillance and misinformation.

The wise response to powerful technology is neither uncritical embrace nor fearful rejection. It is balance—capturing benefits while mitigating harms.

The Human Standard divides its policy framework into yin and yang: protective measures that guard against automation's downsides, and opportunity measures that help citizens benefit from automation's potential. This chapter presents the yin.

### Immediate Policies (2025-2027)

These policies address urgent needs and establish frameworks for further action.

---

#### 1. Automation Impact Disclosure Act

**The Problem**: Companies deploy automation without public accountability. Workers learn their jobs are threatened only when layoffs are announced. Communities discover their economic base is disappearing only when businesses close.

**The Solution**: Require transparency about automation deployment.

**Provisions**:

- Companies with 500+ employees must report annually on automation metrics
- Reports include: AI/robotics investments, automation-related productivity changes, jobs affected by automation
- Public database allows researchers, policymakers, and communities to track automation trends
- Voluntary reporting encouraged for smaller companies

**Implementation**:

- Department of Labor administers the program
- First reports due 18 months after enactment
- Data published with privacy protections for proprietary information
- Penalties for material misrepresentation

**Why This Matters**: You cannot respond to what you cannot see. Current data on automation deployment is fragmentary, anecdotal, and years out of date. This act creates the information infrastructure necessary for evidence-based policy.

---

#### 2. Displaced Worker Emergency Fund

**The Problem**: Workers displaced by automation face months without income while navigating inadequate unemployment systems. Existing programs are slow, bureaucratic, and insufficient.

**The Solution**: Immediate cash assistance for automation-displaced workers.

**Provisions**:

- the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) for up to 12 months for workers displaced by automation
- Definition: Job eliminated due to AI, robotics, or process automation
- Verification through employer attestation and Labor Department confirmation
- Benefit is in addition to standard unemployment insurance, not replacement
- No requirement that recipients remain in original industry or occupation

**Funding**:

- Initial appropriation from general revenue ($10 billion)
- Phase to automation tax revenue as that system is implemented
- Projected cost: $20-30 billion annually at current displacement rates

**Why This Matters**: The transition from displacement to new employment can take months or years. During this time, workers face mortgage defaults, health insurance loss, and family stress. The Emergency Fund provides a bridge.

---

#### 3. Right to Human Service

**The Problem**: As AI handles more service interactions, human contact becomes scarce. Vulnerable populations—the elderly, disabled, non-English speakers—struggle with automated systems.

**The Solution**: Guarantee human option for essential services.

**Provisions**:

- Healthcare: Right to speak with a human for appointment scheduling, medical questions, billing inquiries
- Government services: Right to human assistance for benefits applications, tax questions, document processing
- Financial services: Right to human contact for account issues, fraud concerns, loan applications
- Consumer protection: Right to reach a human within reasonable time (defined by regulation)

**Implementation**:

- Applies to organizations above size thresholds (varies by sector)
- Does not ban automation—companies can still offer AI options
- Creates right to human alternative, not requirement that everyone use it
- Federal agencies lead by example with human service guarantees

**Penalties**:

- Regulatory enforcement with escalating fines
- Private right of action for systematic violations
- "Human Service Available" certification for compliant organizations

**Why This Matters**: Not everyone can navigate AI systems. The right to human service prevents automation from creating a two-tier system where only the tech-savvy can access services.

---

#### 4. Algorithmic Accountability Act

**The Problem**: AI systems make consequential decisions about employment, credit, housing, and benefits—often without transparency or recourse.

**The Solution**: Require accountability for high-stakes automated decisions.

**Provisions**:

- Covered decisions: Employment, credit, housing, insurance, government benefits
- Transparency: Right to know when AI influenced a decision
- Explanation: Right to understandable explanation of AI reasoning
- Appeal: Right to human review of adverse automated decisions
- Audit: Required bias audits for high-impact AI systems

**Implementation**:

- FTC primary enforcement for commercial applications
- HUD, EEOC, and sector regulators for specific domains
- Third-party auditors certified to conduct bias assessments
- Annual reporting on audit results and remediation

**Why This Matters**: AI systems can embed and amplify bias. Decisions that affect people's lives should be explainable and appealable. Algorithmic accountability ensures AI serves human interests.

---

### Medium-Term Policies (2027-2030)

These policies build on immediate measures and address deeper structural changes.

---

#### 5. Citizen's Royalty Pilot Program

**The Problem**: Traditional employment is declining as the primary means of income distribution, but no alternative system exists.

**The Solution**: Pilot universal basic income in high-displacement regions.

**Phase 1 (2027-2028)**:

- Selection of 3-5 pilot regions with significant automation displacement
- $500/month to all adult residents in pilot areas
- Rigorous evaluation: employment effects, health outcomes, economic impact, social effects
- Control regions for comparison

**Phase 2 (2028-2029)**:

- Expansion based on pilot results
- Increase to $750/month
- Additional regions added
- Refinement of delivery mechanisms

**Phase 3 (2029-2030)**:

- National eligibility with income-based phase-in
- Full Citizen's Royalty for incomes below median
- Graduated reduction above median
- Full implementation pending Phase 3 evaluation

**Funding**:

- Pilot phase: $50 billion from general appropriation
- Expansion phase: Beginning of automation tax revenue integration
- Full implementation: Automation taxes, data dividends, and consolidated existing program funding

**Why This Matters**: Citizen's Royalty is the centerpiece of automation response, but large-scale implementation is unprecedented in America. Pilots provide evidence for design optimization and political feasibility.

---

#### 6. Robot Tax Framework (Automation Productivity Tax)

**The Problem**: Automation generates productivity gains that flow to capital owners. Workers do not share in gains that displaced them.

**The Solution**: Tax automation productivity to fund worker support.

**Design**:

- Tax base: Reduction in labor costs attributable to automation
- Rate: 5% in year 1, increasing to 10% by year 3, and 15% by year 7
- Calculation: Company compares baseline labor/output ratio to current ratio; automation-driven improvement is taxable
- Revenue earmarked for Citizen's Royalty, transition assistance, and community investment

**Exemptions**:

- Companies under 100 employees exempt
- Automation that increases employment exempt
- Automation required for safety exempt
- Phase-in for newly-covered companies

**Revenue Neutrality**:

- Offset with reduced employer payroll taxes
- Net effect: Higher taxes on automation, lower taxes on human labor
- Incentivizes human-machine collaboration over replacement

**Why This Matters**: The robot tax does not prevent automation—it changes who benefits from automation. Instead of gains flowing entirely to owners, a portion funds social insurance for workers.

---

#### 7. Data Dividend Tax

**The Problem**: Tech companies extract enormous value from user data without compensating the users who generate it.

**The Solution**: Treat user data as a resource that citizens own and deserve payment for.

**Design**:

- Tax on data-extracting companies based on data value
- Tiered rates by data type:
  - Behavioral data (browsing, clicks): $2 per user per year
  - Commercial data (purchases, preferences): $5 per user per year
  - Biometric data (face, voice): $15 per user per year
  - Location data: $10 per user per year
- Revenue deposited in National Data Fund
- Annual Data Dividend distributed to all citizens (Alaska model)

**AI Training Data Royalty**:

- 1% of commercial AI revenue to creators whose work trained the AI
- Collective licensing for historical data
- Individual royalty accounts for identified creators

**Why This Matters**: The AI systems transforming the economy are trained on human-generated data. The value created should be shared with the people who created that data.

---

#### 8. Portable Benefits System

**The Problem**: Healthcare, retirement, and other benefits are tied to employment. Workers who change jobs, work multiple jobs, or exit traditional employment lose benefits.

**The Solution**: Benefits that follow workers, not jobs.

**Design**:

- Individual benefit accounts for each worker
- Funded by combination of employer contributions, employee contributions, and government subsidy
- Accounts cover: healthcare, retirement, disability, paid leave, training
- Portable across employers, employment types, and career transitions
- Pro-rated contributions for gig and part-time work

**Implementation**:

- Phase 1: Voluntary system with tax incentives
- Phase 2: Mandatory participation for employers above size thresholds
- Phase 3: Universal system for all workers

**Why This Matters**: The traditional employment relationship is eroding. Benefits must be decoupled from employment to ensure workers have security regardless of how they work.

---

#### 9. Regional Economic Transition Zones

**The Problem**: Automation impacts are geographically concentrated. Communities built around automating industries face economic collapse.

**The Solution**: Targeted investment in vulnerable regions.

**Zone Designation**:

- Labor Department identifies Transition Zones based on automation exposure
- Factors: Industry concentration in automatable sectors, education levels, alternative employment options
- Zones eligible for enhanced assistance for 10 years

**Zone Benefits**:

- Enhanced Citizen's Royalty: Additional $250/month for zone residents
- Infrastructure investment: Federal priority for roads, broadband, public facilities
- Business incentives: Tax credits for job creation in zones
- Education investment: Community college and training program expansion
- Relocation assistance: Support for residents who choose to move

**Why This Matters**: National policies help individuals; regional policies help communities. Some places will need extraordinary help to survive the automation transition.

---

### Long-Term Policies (2030+)

These policies address the full-scale automation transformation.

---

#### 10. Citizen's Royalty Expansion

As automation accelerates, Citizen's Royalty must scale accordingly.

**Implementation**:

- NIT income floor: $24,000-30,000/year for all adult citizens
- Indexed to automation indicators (not just inflation)
- Funding fully from automation dividend, data dividend, carbon tax, and wealth tax
- Regional adjustment for cost of living

**Why This Matters**: The pilot-scale Citizen's Royalty is a floor; expansion creates genuine security as automation eliminates more jobs.

---

#### 11. Sovereign Wealth Fund for Citizens

**The Problem**: Automation creates enormous wealth that concentrates in few hands.

**The Solution**: Public ownership stake in automation's gains.

**Design**:

- National sovereign wealth fund invests in AI/automation companies
- Citizens receive dividend from fund returns
- Over time, fund grows to provide substantial per-capita payments
- Models: Norway (oil), Alaska (oil), Singapore (investment)

**Why This Matters**: Ownership distributes gains more fundamentally than taxation. Every American becomes a stakeholder in automation prosperity.

---

#### 12. Work Week Reduction

**The Problem**: If productivity allows the same output with fewer workers, the remaining work must be distributed differently.

**The Solution**: Gradually reduce the standard work week.

**Implementation**:

- Phase 1: 36-hour standard week (with overtime above)
- Phase 2: 32-hour standard week
- Phase 3: 28-hour standard week (with continued productivity gains)
- Salary levels maintained through productivity sharing

**Why This Matters**: Rather than some people working full-time while others are unemployed, everyone works less while maintaining income. Work is distributed rather than concentrated.

---

#### 13. Universal Basic Services

**The Problem**: Even with income support, some essential services remain out of reach.

**The Solution**: Guarantee basic services regardless of income.

**Coverage**:

- Healthcare: Medicare for All or equivalent universal coverage
- Education: Free public college and vocational training
- Transportation: Basic mobility access in all communities
- Internet: Broadband as public utility
- Housing: Basic housing security (no homelessness)

**Why This Matters**: Citizen's Royalty provides income; UBS ensures that income can meet basic needs regardless of market conditions.

---

### The Protective Framework

These policies form a coherent framework of protection:

- **Information**: Disclosure requirements so we know what is happening
- **Bridges**: Emergency assistance for those already displaced
- **Rights**: Guarantees that essential services remain human-accessible and accountable
- **Income**: Citizen's Royalty providing a universal floor
- **Revenue**: Automation and data taxes ensuring gains are shared
- **Security**: Portable benefits and transition support
- **Place**: Regional investment protecting communities
- **Ownership**: Sovereign wealth funds creating universal stakeholdership
- **Time**: Work week reduction distributing remaining work
- **Services**: Universal basic services meeting fundamental needs

Together, these policies ensure that automation's benefits are distributed and its harms mitigated. They do not prevent technological progress. They ensure that progress serves humanity.
