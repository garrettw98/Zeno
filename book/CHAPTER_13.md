# Chapter 13
## The Failure of Incrementalism

---

In 1962, President Kennedy signed the Trade Expansion Act, which included a little-noticed provision: Trade Adjustment Assistance. The idea was sensible: when trade policy eliminated jobs, the government would help displaced workers find new ones.

The program offered unemployment benefits, job training, and relocation assistance. If your factory closed because of foreign competition, TAA would help you transition to new work.

Sixty years later, we can assess the results.

A comprehensive study found that workers who received TAA assistance fared no better than similar workers who did not. The training programs had minimal effect on reemployment. The relocation assistance went largely unused. The displaced workers remained displaced.

The program still exists. It still spends hundreds of millions annually. It still promises to help workers transition. And it still largely fails.

This is the story of incremental policy responses to structural economic change: programs designed with good intentions that fail to match the scale of the challenge.

### The Retraining Myth

"We'll retrain them." This phrase echoes through every debate about displacement. Factories closing? Retrain the workers. Automation advancing? Retrain the workers. AI taking jobs? Retrain the workers.

The phrase assumes that workers can learn new skills and that those skills will lead to jobs. Both assumptions are questionable.

**Learning new skills is hard.** A 50-year-old steelworker cannot easily become a software engineer. The cognitive demands are different. The time required is substantial. The motivation required is enormous, especially for someone dealing with job loss, financial stress, and uncertain prospects.

**The skills needed keep changing.** Training programs take years to design and implement. By the time workers complete training, the target jobs may also be automating. The paralegal training program that made sense in 2015 looks dubious in 2025 when AI handles legal research.

**Training does not create jobs.** If there are 1,000 unemployed workers and 100 job openings, training does not solve the arithmetic. Better-trained workers might get those 100 jobs, but 900 workers remain unemployed. Training redistributes opportunity; it does not create it.

**Program quality is poor.** Many retraining programs are badly designed, poorly implemented, and disconnected from actual employer needs. Workers complete programs and discover their new credentials are not valued by employers.

The data confirms these concerns. A study of Trade Adjustment Assistance found that training increased earnings by only $50 per quarter—effectively zero. A study of the Workforce Investment Act found similarly dismal results.

This is not an argument against education and training. It is an argument against relying on training as the primary response to mass displacement. When millions of jobs disappear, no amount of training creates millions of new jobs.

### The Education Reform Fantasy

If retraining adults is hard, perhaps we should focus on education—preparing the next generation for the automated economy.

"Learn to code" became the mantra. Promote STEM education. Emphasize computational thinking. Prepare students for the jobs of the future.

This advice was not wrong, but it was insufficient:

**Not everyone can code.** Software development requires aptitudes that not everyone has. Even at its peak, the tech industry employed only a few million people. It cannot absorb tens of millions of displaced workers from other sectors.

**Coding itself is being automated.** The very skills being promoted—programming, data analysis, technical implementation—are exactly what AI does well. Teaching everyone to code when AI writes code is preparing for yesterday's future.

**Education takes time.** A student entering first grade today will not enter the workforce for 15-20 years. The jobs they are being prepared for may not exist by then. We cannot predict what skills will be valuable in 2040.

**The credentialing spiral.** As more people get degrees, employers raise requirements. Jobs that once needed high school now need college. Jobs that needed bachelor's degrees now need master's. The escalation provides individual advantage but collective frustration.

Education reform is necessary. Students should understand technology, think critically, and adapt to change. But education cannot solve the fundamental problem: if there are not enough jobs for humans, no amount of education creates them.

### The Trade Adjustment Template

When manufacturing jobs moved overseas, we developed a policy template: acknowledge the problem, express sympathy for displaced workers, create programs that provide assistance, and then move on to other issues.

The programs were never adequate. The Trade Adjustment Assistance budget peaked at about $1 billion per year—significant, but trivial compared to the scale of manufacturing displacement. Millions of workers lost jobs; the programs served thousands.

The assistance was poorly designed. Complex eligibility requirements excluded many displaced workers. Benefits were time-limited, running out before workers found stable employment. The skills training was disconnected from actual job markets.

The political attention was temporary. After initial acknowledgment, policymakers moved to other priorities. The workers who lost their homes, communities, and futures became statistics rather than urgent concerns.

And most importantly, the programs addressed symptoms while ignoring causes. Workers were displaced not by accident but by policy choices: trade agreements, tax incentives, regulatory differences. The programs tried to help workers adapt to displacement while policymakers continued creating displacement.

The result is visible in every Rust Belt town: a generation of workers who were promised help, received minimal assistance, and never recovered.

### The Speed Mismatch

Policy moves slowly. Technology moves fast. This mismatch is structural and growing.

**Legislative cycles**: Passing major legislation takes years. Building coalitions, crafting language, navigating committees, resolving conference differences, surviving filibusters—the process is designed for deliberation, not speed. By the time Congress responds to technological change, the landscape has shifted again.

**Regulatory lag**: Agencies must gather information, propose rules, accept comments, revise proposals, and defend final rules against legal challenge. This process can take a decade. Meanwhile, technology advances continuously.

**Implementation delay**: Even after legislation passes and rules are written, implementation takes time. Building bureaucracies, hiring staff, developing procedures, distributing benefits—years pass between policy decision and policy effect.

**Feedback loops**: Assessing whether policies work requires years of data. By the time we learn that a program failed, resources have been committed, constituencies have formed, and changing course is politically difficult.

Technology operates on different timescales:

- AI models improve by significant percentages per year
- Deployment can scale globally within months
- New capabilities emerge unpredictably
- Companies operate on quarterly cycles, responding rapidly to competitive pressure

The mismatch is not fixable through better policy design. It is inherent in the nature of democratic governance and technological development. Fast policy is dangerous (hasty, error-prone); slow policy is inadequate (outdated before implementation).

The solution is not faster policy but different policy: frameworks that adapt automatically to changing conditions, benefit structures that do not require continual legislative action, systems that respond to displacement as it occurs rather than years later.

### Regulatory Capture

Even when policy is well-designed, implementation often favors the regulated rather than the public.

Regulatory capture occurs when agencies meant to regulate industries instead serve those industries' interests. The regulated parties have concentrated interests, ample resources, and permanent engagement. The public has diffuse interests, limited resources, and sporadic attention.

Consider AI regulation:

**Industry writes the rules**: Major AI companies have large policy teams that engage continuously with regulators. They fund research that supports their positions. They provide technical expertise that regulators lack. The resulting rules often reflect industry preferences.

**Revolving doors**: Regulators frequently move to industry positions, and industry veterans join regulatory agencies. These career paths create relationships and perspectives that favor industry concerns.

**Information asymmetry**: Companies know more about their technology than regulators do. They control what information flows to policymakers. They can emphasize benefits while minimizing risks.

**Lobbying resources**: The major AI companies have billions in resources. They can afford to engage every policymaker, support every study, challenge every unfavorable regulation. Public interest groups operate on tiny fractions of these budgets.

The result: regulations that appear to address concerns while actually preserving industry freedom to operate. Safety requirements that industry can easily meet. Disclosure rules that provide minimal meaningful information. Enforcement mechanisms that are rarely used.

Regulatory capture is not conspiracy. It is the predictable result of concentrated interests facing diffuse opposition. Without structural changes—public funding for regulatory capacity, reduced revolving doors, mandatory public interest representation—capture will continue.

### The Political Economy of Inaction

Why do inadequate policies persist? Why don't policymakers respond effectively to displacement?

Several factors explain the pattern:

**Concentrated opposition, diffuse support**: The companies benefiting from automation have intense interest in avoiding taxes or regulations. Displaced workers have diffuse interests spread across many districts. Concentrated opposition beats diffuse support in political contests.

**Future problems, present costs**: Responding to automation requires spending money now on problems that are not yet fully visible. Politicians face pressure to address current crises, not future ones. The political incentive is to defer.

**Complexity and uncertainty**: Automation's effects are complex and contested. Experts disagree. Predictions vary. This uncertainty creates space for inaction—why act boldly when the problem might not materialize?

**Ideological commitments**: Both left and right have ideological reasons for inadequate response. Free-market conservatives resist intervention; progressives struggle with programs that do not fit traditional labor organizing models.

**Campaign finance**: The companies driving automation fund political campaigns. Politicians depend on their support. This does not require explicit corruption; it shapes the political environment in which policy is made.

**Geographic distribution**: Displaced workers concentrate in specific regions. Politicians from prosperous areas feel less urgency. The senators from California and New York, where tech creates jobs, have different perspectives than senators from Ohio and Pennsylvania, where automation destroys them.

Overcoming these factors requires political mobilization that matches the intensity of industry opposition. The Human Standard proposes policies; political movements must make them happen.

### What Incrementalism Cannot Do

Incremental policy has achieved some good. Social Security lifted millions from poverty. Medicare provided healthcare to the elderly. The Affordable Care Act extended coverage to millions more.

But incremental policy cannot address structural transformation at scale. It cannot respond quickly enough to technological acceleration. It cannot overcome concentrated opposition without mobilized support. It cannot change fundamental economic structures while working within existing frameworks.

Automation demands non-incremental response:

**Universal**: Not targeted programs that reach some workers but universal systems that ensure no one falls through cracks.

**Automatic**: Not programs requiring continuous legislative renewal but systems that respond automatically to changing conditions.

**Structural**: Not band-aids on symptoms but changes to the fundamental distribution of economic gains.

**Pre-emptive**: Not reactive response after damage is done but proactive preparation before displacement occurs.

The Human Standard is designed as a non-incremental response: universal basic income rather than targeted assistance, automation taxes that adjust automatically with deployment, tiered transparency AI governances that restructure the industry rather than regulate its edges.

### Learning from Failure

The failure of incrementalism is not inevitable. Other countries have responded more effectively to economic transitions.

**Germany's Kurzarbeit**: When recession threatens jobs, German companies reduce hours rather than laying off workers. The government subsidizes the shortened workweeks. Workers retain employment; companies retain trained workers; mass unemployment is avoided. The program responded to the 2008 recession and the COVID pandemic with remarkable effectiveness.

**Denmark's Flexicurity**: The Danish model combines flexible labor markets (easy to hire and fire) with generous unemployment benefits and active labor market programs. Workers can be displaced without catastrophe because the safety net catches them. The programs are well-funded and actively connect workers to jobs.

**Singapore's SkillsFuture**: Every adult citizen receives credits for education and training throughout their lives. The system is universal, not means-tested. It recognizes that careers span decades during which skills must evolve.

These examples are not perfect. They operate in smaller, more homogeneous societies. They face their own challenges. But they demonstrate that effective response to economic change is possible—that incrementalism is not the only option.

The question is whether America will learn from these examples or continue with failed approaches.

### The Path Forward

Incrementalism fails because it accepts existing structures while trying to address their symptoms. The symptoms persist because the structures produce them.

The path forward requires changing structures:

**From targeted programs to universal systems**: Instead of trying to identify and help displaced workers, ensure all citizens have income security. Universal basic income makes eligibility automatic and universal.

**From reactive to pre-emptive**: Instead of responding after displacement, build systems that prevent catastrophic harm. Early warning systems, transition funds, and automatic stabilizers that kick in as displacement occurs.

**From temporary to permanent**: Instead of programs that expire and require renewal, create structures that persist. The Alaska Permanent Fund has distributed oil revenue for decades without requiring continuous legislative action.

**From employment-based to citizenship-based**: Instead of tying benefits to jobs, provide them to all citizens. Healthcare, retirement security, and basic income should not depend on having the right employer.

These are not incremental changes. They are structural transformations. They require political will that incrementalism does not demand.

But they are necessary. The failure of incrementalism is not temporary. It is fundamental. The same reasons that caused past programs to fail will cause future programs to fail—unless we design differently.

The Human Standard is that different design.
