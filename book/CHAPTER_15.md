## The Political Divide on Automation

---

In American politics, every issue is processed through the left-right divide. Healthcare becomes a fight between government control and market freedom. Climate becomes a battle between regulation and jobs. Immigration splits along humanitarian versus enforcement lines.

Automation does not fit this pattern.

The technology being deployed cuts across traditional political coalitions. The workers being displaced are both urban progressives and rural conservatives. The solutions proposed draw from libertarian, progressive, and populist traditions simultaneously.

This creates both opportunity and difficulty. Opportunity: a new coalition might form around shared concern about automation's effects. Difficulty: existing political identities and loyalties must be navigated before that coalition can act.

Understanding how different political perspectives see automation is essential for building the coalition that can respond to it.

### The Conservative Perspective

Traditional conservatives approach automation through free-market principles:

**Market adaptation**: The economy will adjust. It always has. Previous technological revolutions displaced workers, but new industries absorbed them. Government intervention is unnecessary and likely counterproductive—it will distort markets, create dependencies, and reduce efficiency.

**Individual responsibility**: Workers who are displaced should retrain, relocate, and adapt. This is what Americans have always done. Providing guaranteed income removes the incentive to adjust, creating permanent dependency.

**Deregulation**: The proper response to automation is less regulation, not more. Let companies deploy technology freely. The resulting productivity gains will create prosperity that benefits everyone through lower prices and economic growth.

**Small government**: Citizen's Royalty and automation taxes represent massive expansion of government power and spending. This violates core conservative principles about limited government and fiscal responsibility.

**Property rights**: Taxing companies for using robots or AI violates property rights. Businesses should be free to invest in whatever technology they choose without penalty.

These arguments have intellectual coherence. They reflect genuine conservative principles applied to a new situation. But they face challenges:

- The historical pattern of adjustment took decades; AI advances in years
- Individual adaptation is difficult when entire occupations are automated
- The market is not creating replacement jobs at the rate it is eliminating them
- Corporate concentration undermines the competitive markets that make adjustment work

Some conservatives are reconsidering. Economic populists within the Republican coalition—Tucker Carlson, Josh Hawley, J.D. Vance—have expressed openness to policies that would have been heresy a decade ago. The transformation of working-class communities has created space for new thinking.

### The Progressive Perspective

Progressives approach automation through the lens of worker protection and economic justice:

**Worker power**: The fundamental issue is power imbalance between capital and labor. Automation strengthens capital's hand. The response must strengthen workers' position—through unions, regulations, and social programs that reduce dependence on employers.

**Redistribution**: The productivity gains from automation belong to society, not just to owners of the technology. Taxes and transfers should ensure workers share in gains they helped create through their labor and data.

**Government intervention**: Markets will not protect workers adequately. Government must intervene—regulating AI deployment, providing safety nets, investing in job creation, and ensuring technology serves social goals.

**Corporate accountability**: Companies profiting from automation must be held responsible for its effects. Disclosure requirements, transition assistance obligations, and community investment mandates should accompany automation deployment.

**Universal programs**: Targeted assistance fails too many people. Universal programs—healthcare, childcare, income support—provide security without stigma and reach everyone who needs help.

These arguments also have coherence. They apply progressive principles to technological change. But they face challenges:

- Traditional labor organizing is difficult with atomized workforces
- Government programs have often failed to help displaced workers effectively
- Global competition limits what any one country can require of corporations
- The automation challenge is so large it strains even ambitious progressive programs

Some progressives resist Citizen's Royalty, fearing it could become a replacement for robust public services rather than a complement. They prefer job guarantees that preserve the dignity and structure of work. This tension within the progressive coalition affects policy design.

### The Libertarian Perspective

Libertarians approach automation through individual freedom and skepticism of government:

**Technology embrace**: Technological progress is inherently good. It increases human capability, reduces drudgery, and creates prosperity. Attempts to slow or regulate technology harm innovation.

**Citizen's Royalty appeal**: Surprisingly, many libertarians support some form of Citizen's Royalty—not from progressive instincts but from recognition that it could replace the bureaucratic welfare state. A simple cash transfer is more efficient and less paternalistic than dozens of overlapping programs with different rules and administrators.

**Market solutions**: If automation creates problems, markets will solve them. Entrepreneurs will create new industries, new jobs, new ways to generate value. Government does not need to plan the transition; it needs to get out of the way.

**Sound money interest**: Libertarians are drawn to cryptocurrency and sound money arguments in The Human Standard. The critique of fiat currency debasement resonates with libertarian economic thinking.

**Minimal regulation**: Whatever policy response emerges, it should minimize government control. No mandates on how companies deploy technology, no bureaucracies determining who qualifies for assistance, no central planning of economic transition.

The libertarian perspective offers both allies and obstacles:

- Their efficiency critique of existing programs is valid
- Their embrace of technology can prevent Luddite overreaction
- Their support for simple cash transfers aligns with Citizen's Royalty design
- But their resistance to taxation and regulation limits policy options
- And their faith in market adjustment may be misplaced for this challenge

### The Populist Perspective

Populism—both left and right variants—approaches automation through anti-elite sentiment:

**Elite betrayal**: The people making decisions about AI deployment are not the people affected by it. Tech executives, policymakers, and investors benefit while workers and communities suffer. This is not accident but class interest.

**Rigged system**: The rules of the economy favor those with capital. Automation accelerates this favoritism. The system must be fundamentally changed, not just adjusted at the margins.

**Forgotten Americans**: Both left populism (Bernie Sanders) and right populism (Donald Trump) speak for people who feel the economy has left them behind. Automation is another force impoverishing them while enriching elites.

**Anti-globalism**: Automation is often linked to globalization—both represent forces beyond workers' control that eliminate their livelihoods. Resistance to both comes from the same source.

**Immediate relief**: Abstract policy debates matter less than concrete help now. Populists emphasize immediate assistance over long-term restructuring.

The populist perspective offers energy and urgency:

- Their critique of elite decision-making is valid
- Their focus on affected communities is morally important
- Their ability to mobilize working-class voters is politically essential
- But populism can be captured by demagogues offering easy answers
- And its anti-establishment stance can prevent coalition building with establishment reformers

### Finding Common Ground

Despite different starting points, the political perspectives converge on certain themes:

**The problem is real**: Whether you are conservative, progressive, libertarian, or populist, the data on automation displacement is difficult to dismiss. Disagreement is about response, not reality.

**Current policy is failing**: Existing programs—job training, trade adjustment, unemployment insurance—are not working. Everyone agrees on this, though they disagree about why and what to do.

**Workers deserve help**: The moral intuition that displaced workers should not simply be abandoned is shared across perspectives. People disagree about what help looks like, but not about whether help is warranted.

**Cash has advantages**: From different perspectives, cash transfers have appeal. Conservatives like efficiency; progressives like universality; libertarians like simplicity; populists like immediate impact. The specifics of Citizen's Royalty are debated, but the basic approach has cross-ideological support.

**Concentration is concerning**: The power being accumulated by major AI companies troubles everyone—conservatives worry about market dominance, progressives about worker exploitation, libertarians about crony capitalism, populists about elite control.

These areas of agreement provide foundation for coalition building.

### The Coalition Potential

The Human Standard is designed to appeal across political divides:

**To conservatives**: We offer market-based mechanisms (automation taxes that adjust incentives rather than mandates), efficiency gains from replacing bureaucratic programs with simple cash transfers, purchasing power stability options that protect against currency debasement, and open-source requirements that prevent government from controlling AI.

**To progressives**: We offer universal programs that leave no one behind, redistribution of automation gains from capital to workers, strong labor protections during transition, and human-centered metrics that prioritize wellbeing over GDP.

**To libertarians**: We offer program simplification (Citizen's Royalty replacing dozens of welfare programs), individual choice (cash rather than services), technology embrace (open-source AI rather than bans), and sound money alternatives (Bitcoin legal tender).

**To populists**: We offer immediate help for displaced workers, direct payments that bypass corrupt intermediaries, policies designed by and for regular Americans rather than elites, and fundamental system change rather than marginal adjustments.

No coalition satisfies everyone perfectly. Conservatives will resist tax increases; progressives will worry about program adequacy; libertarians will resist government expansion; populists will suspect co-optation by elites.

But each group can accept some policies from The Human Standard even while opposing others. The question is whether the shared concern about automation creates enough common ground to act.

### The Coming Political Realignment

Automation may force a political realignment.

The current left-right axis emerged from industrial-era conflicts: labor versus capital, regulation versus markets, government versus private sector. These conflicts remain relevant but no longer capture the central economic question.

The automation-era axis might look different:

- Those who benefit from automation versus those displaced by it
- Owners of capital versus workers who lack capital
- Citizens of thriving regions versus citizens of declining regions
- Those who trust institutions versus those who do not

This axis cuts across the old one. A tech worker in Seattle and a manufacturing worker in Ohio have less in common than their shared American identity suggests. A progressive who works for Google and a conservative who drives trucks may find themselves on opposite sides of automation questions even as they remain on the same side of traditional left-right issues.

Political parties will adapt, or be replaced by parties that do. The party that can speak credibly to automation concerns—that can unite displaced workers across ideological lines—may gain electoral dominance.

The Human Standard provides the ideological framework for such a coalition. Whether that coalition forms within existing parties or creates new ones remains to be seen.

### The Electoral Opportunity

Andrew Yang's 2020 campaign demonstrated that automation can be a galvanizing political issue. Despite starting with zero name recognition, he built a movement around Citizen's Royalty and automation concerns. The "Yang Gang" included unlikely coalition members—tech workers and truckers, libertarians and progressives.

The opportunity has grown since then:

- AI has advanced far beyond 2020 capabilities
- ChatGPT has made automation visible to ordinary people
- Economic anxiety has increased
- Pilot programs have generated positive evidence
- More politicians are speaking about automation

The 2028 and 2032 elections will occur as AI deployment accelerates. Candidates who can speak credibly about automation—who understand the technology, acknowledge the concerns, and offer coherent responses—may have significant electoral advantage.

The candidate need not endorse every Human Standard policy. But they must engage seriously with the automation question. Candidates who ignore it, or offer only platitudes about "preparing for the jobs of the future," will seem out of touch with lived experience.

### Building the Movement

Political change requires more than good ideas. It requires organization, mobilization, and pressure.

**Build local chapters**: The Human Standard is not a top-down organization but a movement. Local groups can organize around shared concerns, discuss policies, and build relationships.

**Engage with both parties**: The Human Standard is nonpartisan. Work within Republican and Democratic parties to move both toward automation-responsive policies.

**Support allied candidates**: When candidates embrace Human Standard positions, support them—regardless of party.

**Pressure opponents**: When candidates ignore or dismiss automation concerns, hold them accountable. Ask questions at town halls. Highlight their silence.

**Build media presence**: The automation story is compelling. Journalists need sources and perspectives. Become the person they call when covering these issues.

**Connect with affected communities**: The most powerful advocates are those directly affected. Displaced workers, communities facing automation, workers worried about their futures—their voices are essential.

The political divide on automation is real. Different perspectives will not fully reconcile. But a coalition broad enough to act can form if those who care about automation find ways to work together despite disagreements on other issues.

The question is not whether we can solve automation. It is whether we can organize to try.
