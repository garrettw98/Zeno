# STORIES
## Faces of the Transition
### The Human Standard

---

> *"Statistics are human beings with the tears dried off."* — Paul Brodeur

---

## Introduction

Policy frameworks and philosophical arguments matter. But movements are built on stories. The Human Standard exists because of real people—people displaced by automation, people struggling with inflation, people deceived by deepfakes, and people whose lives were transformed by unconditional cash.

These are their stories. Some are happening now. Some show what is possible. Some warn of what we must prevent.

The tears are not dried off here.

## Part I: The Displacement

### Olivia Lipkin — The Copywriter Replaced by ChatGPT

**San Francisco, 2023**

When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, Olivia Lipkin, 25, didn't think much about it. She was the only writer at a San Francisco tech startup, good at her job, confident in her skills.

Then articles about using ChatGPT began appearing in internal Slack channels. Over the following months, her assignments dwindled. Managers started referring to her as "Olivia/ChatGPT" in messages—as if she and the bot were interchangeable.

In April 2023, she was let go without explanation. But when she found managers writing about how ChatGPT was cheaper than paying a writer, the reason became clear.

"Whenever people brought up ChatGPT, I felt insecure and anxious that it would replace me," she said. "Now I actually had proof that it was true, that those anxieties were warranted and now I was actually out of a job because of AI."

**Today, Olivia is a dog walker.**

### Eric Fein — Ten Years of Work, Gone Overnight

**United States, 2023**

Eric Fein built his content-writing business over ten years. He charged $60 an hour to write everything from bath mat descriptions to cannabis company website copy. He had ten regular clients. He had a career.

In March 2023, his largest client sent a note: his services would no longer be needed. They were transitioning to ChatGPT. One by one, his nine other contracts were canceled for the same reason.

His entire business was gone nearly overnight.

He urged his clients to reconsider, warning that ChatGPT couldn't match his creativity, technical precision, and originality. His clients understood. But they told him it was far cheaper to use ChatGPT than to pay his hourly wage.

Quality wasn't the question. Cost was.

**Eric enrolled in courses to become an HVAC technician—a job AI can't do.**

### The Gardening Centre Writer — "Just Put It in ChatGPT"

**United Kingdom, 2024**

A copywriter at a gardening centre noticed something changing about eight months into the job. The assignments were drying up.

"One day, I overheard my boss saying to a colleague, 'Just put it in ChatGPT.' The marketing department started to use it more often to write their blogs, and they were just asking me to proofread."

The copywriter walked around with the manager, who assured them their job was safe.

**They were let go just before Christmas.**

Now working as a PA in cancer research at a university, they reflect: "I feel more settled, but I regret going into copywriting."

### The Copywriting Industry — A Catastrophic Collapse

**United States, 2024**

The numbers tell part of the story. But copywriters living through it tell the rest:

"The drop off from 2022 to 2023 was BAD. The drop off from 2023 to 2024 was CATASTROPHIC."

One copywriter's experience: Early 2024, leads were down, finances felt tight. Then their biggest retainer client—half their income—gave 30 days notice. No renewal.

The new reality: "We'd have people come to us like 'hey, this was written by ChatGPT, can you clean it up?' And we'd charge less because it was just an editing job and not fully writing from scratch."

From professionals to proofreaders of robot text. The degradation is as painful as the displacement.

### Klarna's 700 — The Corporate Calculation

**Sweden/Global, 2024**

Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later company, made headlines when they replaced 700 of their 3,000 customer service agents with AI chatbots. The company saved money. Response times improved. Executives celebrated.

Then reality intervened.

The AI couldn't handle complicated issues—identity theft cases, nuanced complaints, situations requiring human judgment. Klarna quietly hired some customer service employees back.

But not 700. The humans who returned were fewer, handling only what machines couldn't.

**The 700 who lost their jobs did not get them back.**

### Salesforce — 4,000 Jobs, One Sentence

**San Francisco, 2024-2025**

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff explained the company's customer support cuts with brutal clarity:

"I've reduced [support staff] from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads. 50% of customer queries are now resolved by AI agents instead of humans."

4,000 people. "Heads." Resolved by AI.

This is the language of the displacement. Workers are not people with families and mortgages and dreams. They are "heads" to be counted and reduced.

### India's Call Centers — The Back Office Closes

**India, 2024-2025**

For decades, India was the world's back office. English proficiency and low wages made it the destination for customer service, technical support, and data management. Millions of young graduates found middle-class careers with headsets and cubicles.

Now AI is coming for them.

LimeChat, an Indian startup, has an audacious goal: make customer service jobs almost obsolete. Their pitch to clients: "Once you hire a LimeChat agent, you never have to hire again." They claim their AI can reduce workers needed by 80%.

The scramble to adapt has begun. But for the graduates trained for jobs that are disappearing, adaptation means starting over.

### The Retail Paradox — Sales Up, Jobs Flat

**United States, 2025**

Here is a paradox that reveals the future:

U.S. retail sales have surged for seven consecutive quarters. Consumers are spending. The economy is growing.

Yet frontline store employment has remained stubbornly flat.

Self-checkout kiosks, AI-powered systems, and e-commerce fulfillment have broken the link between sales and jobs. More transactions don't mean more workers. They mean more machines.

300,000 cashier jobs disappeared between 2019 and 2023. Women—73% of cashiers—bear the heaviest burden. The "so-so automation" that MIT economist Daron Acemoglu identified continues: technology that displaces workers without generating significant productivity gains.

**The displacement is not dramatic. It is quiet. A job opening that doesn't get posted. A shift that doesn't get scheduled. A person who doesn't get hired.**

## Part II: The Monetary Erosion

### Michael Dineen — Caring for Dad

**Long Island, New York**

Michael Dineen's father had cancer. Caring for him in his final years should have been about love, presence, and dignity. Instead, it became a financial catastrophe.

"It caused us to spend dad's savings caring for him for the last four years before he passed," Michael says. "Things got so expensive. It took a tremendous toll and can never be undone. Food alone was a huge bill. Clothes went up too."

Inflation didn't just erode purchasing power. It stole the last years of a father-son relationship, turning care into financial crisis.

**This is what 96% purchasing power loss since 1913 looks like in a family's life.**

### Jeff Le — No More Babysitters

**Silver Spring, Maryland**

Jeff Le is a public policy professional with two young children. He and his wife used to have date nights. They used to have babysitters. They used to have a life outside parenting.

Inflation ended that.

Babysitter rates in his area now average around $50 per hour—plus tip. A night out costs $150 before dinner.

"So we pulled back on all of it," Le says. "We haven't used babysitter services in over 18 months."

This is not poverty. This is the middle class being squeezed out of normal life. Connection, relationships, time together as a couple—these are not luxuries. But inflation has made them unaffordable.

### The Retirement Erosion

**United States, 2024**

The Department of Labor's December 2024 report to Congress documented what millions of retirees already knew:

Inflation directly erodes purchasing power. More money is required to purchase the same goods. This is especially problematic for those on fixed income—like retirees.

Pandemic savings are depleted. Financial security has declined. Middle- and upper-income families are actually more stressed now than when inflation was considerably worse—because the cumulative damage has set in.

**The promise of retirement security has been inflated away. The system that was supposed to protect savers has punished them.**

## Part III: The Trust Collapse

### Heidi Swan — "It Looked Just Like Elon Musk"

**United States, 2024**

Heidi Swan saw an advertisement on Facebook and TikTok. A man who looked like Elon Musk, sounded like Elon Musk, was promoting an investment opportunity.

"Looked just like Elon Musk, sounded just like Elon Musk and I thought it was him," she told CBS News.

She sent $10,000 to scammers.

It was a deepfake. The technology that can make anyone say anything had found her. Her trust in what she could see and hear was weaponized against her.

### Steve Beauchamp — The Retirement Fund

**United States, 2024**

Steve Beauchamp is 82 years old. He worked his whole life. He saved for retirement. He trusted what he could see.

"I mean, the picture of him — it was him," he said about the deepfake Elon Musk promoting a cryptocurrency investment. "Now, whether it was A.I. making him say the things that he was saying, I really don't know."

**Steve drained his retirement fund. He invested $690,000 in the scam.**

An 82-year-old man who did everything right—worked, saved, planned for the future—lost everything because technology can now make anyone appear to say anything.

### Anne — The Brad Pitt Romance

**France, 2024**

A French woman named Anne was targeted in what investigators called "a full-blown, AI-powered, deepfake-fueled fraud."

Scammers posed as Brad Pitt. They used AI to generate images, videos, and voice messages that looked and sounded like the actor. They played the long game, building trust over time, targeting Anne at a vulnerable moment.

**She lost nearly $1 million.**

The emotional devastation may be worse than the financial loss. She didn't fall for a scam. She fell in love with a person who never existed, manufactured by algorithms designed to exploit human connection.

### Arup — The $25 Million Video Call

**Hong Kong, 2024**

A finance worker at Arup, the British multinational engineering firm, was tricked into paying $25 million to fraudsters.

The scam: a video conference call with what appeared to be the company's CFO and several other staff members. The worker saw his colleagues. He heard them speak. He followed their instructions.

**Every person on that call was a deepfake.**

The elaborate scam used real-time video manipulation to create synthetic versions of actual employees. The worker had no way to know. Seeing was no longer believing.

## Part IV: The Hope

### Tomas Vargas Jr. — Stockton SEED

**Stockton, California, 2019-2021**

In 2019, Tomas Vargas Jr. had two kids, ages six and seven. He worked part time with extra side jobs to get by. He and his wife lived paycheck to paycheck. The stress was constant.

Then he was randomly selected for Stockton's SEED program: $500 per month, no strings attached, for two years.

"It helped me not only pay my bills and get a better credit score, but it actually helped me feel what a zero balance was like," Tomas said. "It just helped me build that financial structure where I was able to keep that ongoing pattern to keep my finances straight."

He got tutors for his two children. His daughter wants to be an astronaut. His son is good at math. The money didn't make them lazy. It gave them possibilities.

"It freed me up and gave me just another gust of wind."

**Tomas recently landed a new job at the local airport.**

### The Woman Who Could Smile

**Stockton, California, 2019-2021**

She had gone two years with really bad teeth. No insurance. No money for dental work. Every day she hid her smile.

The $500 monthly payment from the SEED program was unconditional. She could spend it on anything. She chose dentures.

"Now she can smile," the researchers noted.

**Basic income didn't trap her in dependency. It gave her back her dignity.**

### The Stockton Results — By the Numbers

**Stockton, California, 2019-2021**

125 randomly selected residents received $500 per month for 24 months. No work requirements. No conditions. No strings.

The critics predicted laziness, dependency, waste.

The results:

- **Full-time employment increased:** 28% had full-time work at the start; 40% one year later
- **Recipients found jobs at double the rate of non-recipients**
- **Only 1% spent on tobacco and alcohol**
- **Emotional health improved significantly**
- **Money went to necessities: food, bills, children**

Stockton was the first U.S. city in decades to run a guaranteed income program. Since then, dozens of cities have followed: Cambridge, Atlanta, St. Paul, Birmingham.

**The fear that people would do nothing was not supported by evidence.**

### Finland — Happier, Less Stressed, More Trusting

**Finland, 2017-2018**

2,000 unemployed Finns received 560 euros per month for two years. No conditions. No requirements. Participation was mandatory for those selected—no self-selection bias.

The findings:

- Recipients were **significantly happier**
- They experienced **fewer problems with stress and concentration**
- They were **more confident in their future**
- They had **more trust in other people and institutions**
- Employment improved slightly (6 additional days worked)
- Some found new ways to participate—volunteering, caregiving, creative work

One woman explained why the money mattered even when she couldn't work: She needed to care for her elderly parents. Every time the phone rang, she feared it was the unemployment office with a job offer she would have to refuse.

**The basic income gave her peace.**

### Kenya — The 48% Reduction

**Kenya, 2011-Present**

GiveDirectly has delivered over $163 million in unconditional cash transfers to more than 406,000 people in Kenya since 2011.

The results are not marginal. They are transformative:

- **Infant deaths reduced by 48%** in families receiving $1,000 transfers
- **Consumption increased 23%** (food, medicine, education)
- **Asset investment increased 58%** (livestock, furniture, metal roofs)
- **Happiness and life satisfaction increased; stress and depression decreased**

One recipient explained: "I've always had a lot of passion for beekeeping, but my financial situation made it impossible. With the money I received, I was able to buy the right equipment and start beekeeping and selling honey again."

A refugee from Congo used his transfers to improve his barber shop. He raised his prices, increased his income to $400/month, and hired an employee.

**Cash didn't create dependency. It created entrepreneurs.**

### Alaska — 40 Years of Dividends

**Alaska, 1982-Present**

Since 1982, every Alaska resident has received an annual dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund—their share of the state's oil wealth.

The results over four decades:

- Alaska is one of the most income-equal states in the USA
- The poorest fifth of families saw income increase 28% over ten years (vs. 7% for richest fifth)
- Poverty reduction, particularly among indigenous Alaskans
- No collapse of work ethic
- No mass idleness
- No dependency spiral

For 2025, the dividend is $1,000 per person. A family of four receives $4,000. It's not enough to live on. But it's enough to matter—for heating fuel in rural Alaska, for education expenses, for unexpected emergencies.

**Forty years of universal cash payments. The apocalypse never came.**

## Part V: The Transition

### Eric Fein's Choice — From Copywriter to HVAC

**United States, 2023-2024**

When Eric Fein lost his copywriting business to ChatGPT, he faced a choice: fight a losing battle against AI, or find work AI cannot do.

He chose HVAC.

"Now, Fein has decided to pursue a job that AI can't do, and he has enrolled in courses to become an HVAC technician."

This is the individual solution to an economy-wide problem. Eric can adapt. But millions cannot. What happens to the 82-year-old who can't retrain? The single mother who can't afford courses? The person in a region with no alternative jobs?

**Eric's story is inspiring. It is also insufficient. Individual adaptation cannot solve systemic displacement.**

*Source: [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/ai-taking-jobs/)*

### The 80/20 Promise — And Its Limits

**Global, 2024**

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, 80% of CEOs investing heavily in AI publicly pledged to retain and retrain existing employees.

But the data tells a different story:

- 36.8% of companies have already reduced headcount through layoffs due to AI
- 55.7% have reduced hiring of new workers
- Nearly 3 in 10 companies have already replaced workers with AI
- 37% expect to do so by 2026

The pledges are sincere. The math is unforgiving. When AI can do work cheaper, the pressure to cut is enormous. Individual company commitments cannot survive competitive dynamics.

**This is why policy matters. Without systemic solutions, individual good intentions fail.**

## Part VI: What 2040 Could Look Like

### Maria — A Day in the Life (The Human Standard Future)

**Denver, Colorado, 2040**

Maria wakes without an alarm. She used to set three, back when she worked at the call center. That was before.

The automation dividend hits her account on the first of every month—$1,800. Not luxury, but security. Rent, food, healthcare covered. The fear that used to wake her at 3 AM—what if I lose my job?—is gone. She already lost it. And she's fine.

This morning she'll mentor at the community art center. Three teenagers are learning sculpture. One of them, Jaylen, has real talent. Under the old system, he'd be flipping burgers, his gift undiscovered. Now he has time to develop it. So does she.

After lunch with her sister—time for family being abundant now—she works on her own pieces. Some she gives away. Some sell at the makers' market. Income isn't the point. The work is.

Her mother lives three blocks away, not in a facility. The care infrastructure supports aging in place, but the human presence—dinner together, shared memories, simply being with—that's Maria's gift to give. She couldn't have given it when she worked 50 hours a week.

She ends the day tired in the way that matters. Not the exhaustion of surviving. The tiredness of living.

**This is not utopia. It is possibility.**

---

### James — The Displaced Worker (Without The Human Standard)

**Dayton, Ohio, 2040**

James used to be a truck driver. Twenty-two years on the road. Then the autonomous trucks came.

They promised retraining. The programs were underfunded, oversubscribed, and designed for younger people. At 54, he couldn't compete with 25-year-olds for the few tech jobs available.

He drives for a gig app now—the irony not lost on him. But those jobs are disappearing too as autonomous delivery expands. Each month brings fewer rides, lower pay, more competition.

His savings are gone. His marriage didn't survive the stress. His health insurance disappeared with his union job. The chest pains he's been ignoring—he can't afford to get them checked.

The politicians talk about "the future of work." James knows what that future looks like. He's living it.

**This is not dystopia. It is trajectory.**

---

### The Fork in the Road

**2025**

Both futures are possible. Maria's life requires policy choices we haven't made yet. James's life requires only that we continue on the current path.

The Human Standard exists to build Maria's world. The stories in this document show why it matters—not as abstract philosophy, but as the difference between lives of dignity and lives of desperation.

The displaced workers are not statistics. They are Olivia and Eric and the gardening centre writer.

The eroded savings are not data points. They are Michael caring for his dying father and Jeff who can't afford a babysitter.

The trust collapse is not theoretical. It is Steve who lost his retirement and Anne who lost her heart to a person who never existed.

And the hope is not fantasy. It is Tomas and his astronaut daughter, the woman who can smile again, the Kenyan beekeeper, the forty years of Alaskan dividends.

**These are the faces of the transition. These are the stakes.**

---

## Conclusion: Why Stories Matter

Policy papers convince minds. Stories move hearts.

The Human Standard will succeed or fail based on whether people see themselves in it. The worker afraid of automation must see that we understand their fear—and have answers. The saver watching inflation erode their future must see that we understand their anger—and offer alternatives. The citizen who no longer knows what to believe must see that we understand their confusion—and are building truth infrastructure.

These stories are not decoration. They are the core.

Every statistic in our policy frameworks represents a human being. Every policy we propose exists to serve someone like the people in these pages. Every argument we make is ultimately about whether Maria's life or James's life becomes the future.

We know which future we choose.

Now we build it.
