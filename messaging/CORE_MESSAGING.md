## The Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second Hook
> "Robots should pay taxes too. The Human Standard ensures that when AI and automation create wealth, every American shares in that prosperity—not just the people who own the robots."

### 30-Second Pitch
> "We're entering an age where AI and robots can do most jobs better and cheaper than humans. That's either a nightmare where a few tech billionaires own everything, or it's a golden age where everyone benefits. The Human Standard chooses the golden age. We tax automation, give every American the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) no strings attached, keep AI transparent and accountable, and make sure humans—not algorithms—stay in charge. It's not left or right. It's forward."

### 2-Minute Pitch
> "Here's the truth nobody in Washington wants to say out loud: AI is coming for jobs. Not just factory jobs—lawyers, doctors, accountants, writers. Goldman Sachs says 300 million jobs worldwide could be automated. That's not a future problem. That's happening now.
>
> We have two choices. One: let it happen and watch inequality explode while a handful of tech billionaires accumulate all the wealth. Two: make sure everyone benefits.
>
> The Human Standard chooses option two. Here's how:
>
> First, the Citizen's Royalty. Every adult American gets the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model), no questions asked. Enough to survive, not enough to get lazy. Paid for by taxing the robots and AI systems that replace human workers.
>
> Second, AI accountability. Every algorithm that affects your life—whether you get a loan, a job, bail—has to be transparent. You have the right to know why a computer said no, and the right to appeal to a human.
>
> Third, sound money. We're not going to print our way out of problems. Strategic reserves in Bitcoin, clear rules for digital assets, and no surveillance currency.
>
> This isn't socialism—nobody's seizing the means of production. This isn't libertarian fantasy—we're not pretending the market will magically fix everything. It's a practical framework for making sure technology serves humanity instead of the other way around.
>
> The question isn't whether automation is coming. It's whether we'll be ready. The Human Standard makes us ready."

### 5-Minute Pitch (Full Stump Speech)
> "Let me tell you a story about two futures.
>
> In the first future, it's 2040. Self-driving trucks have eliminated 3 million trucking jobs. AI handles customer service, legal research, medical diagnosis, financial analysis. Unemployment is 25%, but the stock market is at all-time highs. A few hundred billionaires own the robot fleets and AI systems. Everyone else is scrambling for the jobs that are left, competing against each other to work for less and less. The American Dream isn't just dead—it's a cruel joke.
>
> In the second future, it's also 2040. The same technology exists. Self-driving trucks, AI systems, automation everywhere. But something's different. Those robot trucks pay taxes. Those AI systems pay into a fund. And every American adult—working or not—receives a guaranteed income floor. Not welfare. Not charity. Your share of national prosperity. Your share of the productivity your country created together.
>
> In this future, a single mom in Ohio can afford to take night classes without worrying about how she'll pay rent. A small-town entrepreneur can take a risk on a new business without fearing homelessness if it fails. An artist can create without starving. A caregiver can care for their aging parents without going broke. People work because they want to, not because they're terrified of what happens if they don't.
>
> Both futures are possible. But only one happens by accident. And it's not the good one.
>
> The Human Standard is how we get to the good future. It's built on three pillars:
>
> **Pillar One: Economic Security Through the Citizen's Royalty.** Every adult citizen gets the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model). Not means-tested. Not bureaucratic hoops. Direct deposit, every month, for everyone. Funded by the Sovereign Humanity Fund—the same robots and AI systems that are replacing human workers. If a robot does a job a human used to do, the company pays a tax. Simple. Fair.
>
> **Pillar Two: AI Accountability and Transparency.** Right now, algorithms control huge parts of your life. Whether you get a job. Whether you get a loan. Whether you get out on bail. Whether you see your kids. And you have no idea how those decisions are made. That's insane. Under the Human Standard, any AI system that makes important decisions about people's lives has to be transparent. You have the right to an explanation. You have the right to appeal to a human. And the code has to be open source so the public can verify it's fair.
>
> **Pillar Three: Sound Money and Financial Freedom.** We've printed trillions of dollars, and it's debased our currency and enriched Wall Street. The Human Standard puts America on sound footing with a strategic Bitcoin reserve, clear rules for digital assets, and an absolute prohibition on surveillance currency. No central bank digital currency that tracks every purchase. Your money, your business.
>
> Now, I know what some of you are thinking. This sounds expensive. This sounds radical. This sounds like socialism.
>
> Let me address that head-on.
>
> Is it expensive? The automation economy is going to generate trillions in productivity gains. We're not creating new money—we're redirecting gains that would otherwise flow to a tiny elite. The alternative is far more expensive: mass unemployment, social unrest, and a generation written off.
>
> Is it radical? What's radical is letting technology reshape society with no plan whatsoever. What's radical is pretending the market will solve everything when the market is the problem. Prudent preparation for foreseeable change isn't radical—it's responsible.
>
> Is it socialism? Absolutely not. Private property stays private. Markets stay free. We're not nationalizing industries or seizing wealth. We're ensuring that the gains from automation—which build on centuries of public investment in education, infrastructure, and research—flow back to the public. That's not socialism. That's justice.
>
> The Human Standard isn't left-wing or right-wing. It's forward. It's practical. And it's urgent.
>
> Because here's the thing: the automation economy isn't waiting for us to figure this out. Every day, another factory automates. Every day, another AI system gets deployed. Every day, the window to shape this transition closes a little more.
>
> We can choose the first future—the nightmare of mass unemployment and oligarchy. Or we can choose the second future—where technology serves everyone, where every American has economic security, where humans stay in control.
>
> The Human Standard is how we choose the second future.
>
> The only question is: will we be brave enough to choose it?"

## Core Message Framework

### The Big Idea
**Technology should serve humanity—not the other way around.**

### The Problem (Pain Points)
1. AI and automation are eliminating jobs faster than new ones are created
2. The gains from technology flow to a tiny elite while workers are left behind
3. Algorithms control our lives with no transparency or accountability
4. Our money is being debased while surveillance increases
5. Nobody in power has a plan for any of this

### The Solution (The Human Standard)
1. Citizen's Royalty funded by automation taxes
2. Transparent, accountable AI with human oversight
3. Sound money with digital asset freedom
4. Democratic control over technology's trajectory

### The Stakes (Why Now)
- The automation transition is happening NOW, not someday
- Every year of delay makes the transition harder
- We're choosing our future whether we act or not—inaction is a choice
- This is the defining issue of the 21st century

### The Ask
- Support candidates who endorse The Human Standard
- Talk about these ideas with your friends and family
- Join the movement at [website]
- Run for office on this platform

## Common Questions - Quick Answers

**"Won't people just stop working?"**
> "Alaska has paid dividends for 40 years and people still work. Most people want purpose, not just money. And the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) is enough to survive, not enough to get lazy. People will work—but they'll have the power to say no to bad jobs."

**"How do you pay for it?"**
> "Tax the robots. When a company replaces workers with automation, they pay into the fund. Plus data dividends from Big Tech and carbon fees. The money exists—right now it just flows to billionaires."

**"Isn't this socialism?"**
> "Not even close. Private property stays private. Markets stay free. This is capitalism that works for everyone, not just the people who own the robots."

**"Will this kill innovation?"**
> "No. We exempt R&D, safety improvements, and small businesses. The tax just ensures that when automation displaces workers, some of those gains flow back to the public. Innovation continues—it just benefits everyone."

**"Why Bitcoin?"**
> "It's a hedge against monetary instability, an asset that can't be debased by printing, and a strategic reserve for the digital age. Other countries are accumulating. We shouldn't fall behind."

**"What about inflation?"**
> "Citizen's Royalty is funded by taxes, not money printing. And putting money in the hands of people who will spend it locally is less inflationary than QE that pumps up asset prices."
