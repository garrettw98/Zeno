## Universal Basic Income Questions

### Q: Won't people just stop working if you give them free money?

**Short Answer:** No. Alaska has paid dividends for 40+ years and people still work. the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) is enough to survive, not enough to live well. Most people want purpose, not just subsistence.

**Full Answer:**
This concern assumes people only work for money and would prefer to do nothing. That's not how humans work. Studies of UBI pilots consistently show:

- **Alaska Permanent Fund** (40+ years): No measurable reduction in employment
- **Finland pilot** (2017-2018): No reduction in employment; improved wellbeing
- **Stockton SEED** (2019-2021): Full-time employment actually *increased* by 12%
- **Kenya GiveDirectly** (ongoing): Increased entrepreneurship and economic activity

What changes is *why* people work and *what jobs* they accept:
- People leave abusive work situations
- Caregivers can care without poverty
- Entrepreneurs take risks
- Workers retrain for better jobs

The the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) amount is calibrated specifically to provide security without eliminating work incentives. It covers basic needs but doesn't fund a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Most people will continue working—they'll just have more power to choose good jobs over bad ones.

### Q: Why universal? Why not target it to people who really need it?

**Short Answer:** Because means-testing creates poverty traps, bureaucratic waste, and stigma. Universal programs work better and cost less to administer.

**Full Answer:**
Means-tested programs have three fundamental problems:

1. **Poverty Traps**: When you lose benefits as income rises, you can face effective marginal tax rates of 80-100%+. Earn an extra dollar, lose a dollar in benefits. That's a disincentive to work that universal programs don't create.

2. **Administrative Waste**: Verifying eligibility is expensive. Social Security disability determination costs billions. SNAP has fraud prevention systems that cost more than the fraud they prevent. Universal programs have near-zero administrative overhead.

3. **Stigma and Non-Takeup**: Many eligible people don't apply for means-tested benefits due to shame, complexity, or distrust of government. Universal programs have near-100% participation.

Additionally, the phase-out approach in the Human Standard means higher earners receive less net benefit due to the tax structure. The program is effectively progressive without means-testing bureaucracy.

**The Comparison:**
- SNAP: 20%+ of eligible non-participants, massive verification bureaucracy
- Social Security (universal for age): Near-100% participation, minimal overhead
- Alaska PFD (universal): Everyone gets it, no bureaucracy, no stigma

### Q: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) seems arbitrary. How did you arrive at that number?

**Short Answer:** It's approximately the federal poverty line for an individual, providing basic security without replacing work income entirely.

**Full Answer:**
The the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) figure is based on several considerations:

1. **Poverty Line Benchmark**: The 2025 federal poverty line for an individual is approximately $15,000/year. $24,000/year puts every individual above this threshold.

2. **Cost of Living Analysis**: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) covers:
   - Modest housing in most markets (or contributes significantly in expensive ones)
   - Basic food, utilities, transportation
   - Does NOT fully cover middle-class lifestyle—work still necessary for comfortable living

3. **Behavioral Sweet Spot**: High enough to provide security; low enough to maintain work incentives. Research suggests this range optimizes for both.

4. **Fiscal Sustainability**: At full implementation with ~260 million adults, this represents approximately $6.24 trillion annually. With automation tax revenue projecting $500B+ by 2035 and other funding sources, this is achievable as automation proceeds.

5. **Phase-In Approach**: The program starts at $500/month and scales up over 10 years as funding sources mature:
   - Year 1: $500/month
   - Year 5: $1,250/month
   - Year 10: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model)

### Q: What about people who already receive benefits? Does UBI replace them?

**Short Answer:** UBI stacks with Social Security, disability, and other earned benefits. It replaces means-tested welfare programs that create poverty traps.

**Full Answer:**
The Human Standard treats different programs differently:

**UBI Stacks With (No Reduction):**
- Social Security retirement benefits (earned)
- Social Security Disability Insurance (earned)
- Veterans benefits (earned)
- Medicare (health insurance, different category)
- Medicaid (health insurance, preserved)

**UBI Replaces:**
- SNAP (food stamps) - UBI is more flexible and sufficient
- TANF (welfare) - UBI exceeds typical TANF payments
- General assistance programs - Consolidated into UBI
- Housing vouchers - UBI sufficient for housing; vouchers transition out

**Choice Provisions:**
Recipients of replaced programs can choose the higher of:
- Their current benefit level (grandfathered), OR
- The UBI amount

No one loses money during the transition. Over time, as UBI reaches full value, most will prefer UBI's flexibility.

### Q: What about children? Do families get more?

**Short Answer:** Parents receive a supplemental child benefit of $300/month per child, in addition to their own UBI.

**Full Answer:**
The Human Standard includes:

- **Adult UBI**: the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) per adult citizen
- **Child Benefit**: $300/month per child (paid to parent/guardian)

So a family with two parents and two children receives:
- $2,000 + $2,000 + $300 + $300 = $4,600/month = $55,200/year

This ensures families with children have additional resources without creating incentives for having children for the money (the child benefit is modest relative to actual child-rearing costs).

The child benefit is structured to:
- Be paid directly to one custodial parent
- Split equally in joint custody situations
- Include verification to prevent fraud
- Phase out at age 18 when adult UBI begins

## Automation Tax Questions

### Q: Won't taxing automation drive companies overseas?

**Short Answer:** Not significantly. We use border adjustments, and most automation serves local markets that can't be offshored (warehouses, retail, trucking).

**Full Answer:**
This concern applies differently to different types of automation:

**Low Offshoring Risk:**
- Warehouse robots (serve US logistics)
- Self-checkout (installed in US stores)
- Autonomous trucks (drive US highways)
- Customer service AI (for US customers in English)
- Retail automation (physical US presence)

**Moderate Risk (Mitigated):**
- Manufacturing automation
  - Border adjustments apply automation tax to imports
  - Can't sell in US without paying equivalent tax
  - US market access requires compliance

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Border Adjustments**: Imports from countries without equivalent taxes face adjustment at the border
2. **Exemptions for Export**: Automation primarily serving export markets can receive rebates
3. **R&D Carve-Outs**: Research and development automation exempt
4. **Competitive Rates**: Rates set to balance revenue with competitiveness

Companies automate to serve markets. The US is the largest consumer market. Abandoning the US market to avoid automation taxes is rarely economical.

---

### Q: How do you even define and count "robots" for tax purposes?

**Short Answer:** We define taxable automated units based on labor-equivalent output, with clear categories for industrial robots, AI systems, autonomous vehicles, and other automation.

**Full Answer:**
The automation tax uses clear, administrable definitions:

**Category 1: Physical Automation**
- Industrial robots (per IFR definition)
- Warehouse and logistics robots
- Autonomous vehicles (commercial)
- Self-checkout and kiosk systems

Measurement: Count of installed units × FTE-equivalent rating

**Category 2: AI Systems**
- Decision automation (measured by decision volume)
- Customer service AI (measured by interaction volume)
- Content generation AI (measured by output volume)

Measurement: Annual output metrics compared to human productivity benchmarks

**Category 3: Process Automation**
- Robotic process automation
- Automated manufacturing processes
- Algorithmic trading systems

Measurement: Process throughput compared to human-equivalent operations

**Administrative Features:**
- Annual self-reporting by businesses
- Audit verification (random + risk-based)
- Safe harbors for small businesses
- Clear guidance and bright-line rules

The IRS already handles complex business taxation. This is administratively feasible.

---

### Q: Won't this slow down innovation and technological progress?

**Short Answer:** No. R&D is exempt, and the tax only applies to deployment, not development. We want innovation to continue—we just want everyone to benefit.

**Full Answer:**
The automation tax is carefully designed to preserve innovation incentives:

**Exempt Activities:**
- Basic research (100% exempt)
- Applied R&D (50% credit)
- Prototype and pilot programs (deferred until deployment)
- Safety automation (75% credit)
- Accessibility automation (100% credit)
- Small business (first 10 units exempt)
- Green automation (25% credit)

**What's Taxed:**
- Large-scale commercial deployment that replaces workers
- Ongoing operation of deployed automation
- Companies that have already captured efficiency gains

**Why This Preserves Innovation:**
1. Research and development remain fully incentivized
2. The tax targets profits from deployment, not costs of development
3. Companies still capture majority of productivity gains
4. Innovation that doesn't displace workers isn't taxed

Think of it like the gas tax: we don't tax car research, but we tax car operation to fund roads. Same principle here.

---

### Q: What counts as "labor displacement"? What if automation creates new jobs?

**Short Answer:** We tax automation output regardless of net employment effects. If automation creates jobs, great—companies can afford the modest tax. If it destroys jobs, the tax funds the transition.

**Full Answer:**
The Human Standard doesn't require proving specific job displacement for each robot. Instead:

**Tax Basis:**
- Automation is taxed based on its **productive capacity** relative to human workers
- A robot that can do the work of 2.5 humans is taxed accordingly
- Whether the company actually fired workers is irrelevant

**Rationale:**
1. Individual causation is impossible to prove (would Company X have hired otherwise?)
2. Economy-wide effects are what matter, not firm-level decisions
3. Productive automation generates value—some of that value funds UBI
4. If automation truly creates more jobs, the economy thrives and the tax is sustainable

**Net Job Creation Scenarios:**
- If automation creates more jobs than it destroys, the economy grows, tax revenues grow, and the system thrives
- If automation destroys more jobs than it creates, tax revenues fund UBI for displaced workers
- Either way, the policy works

We're not punishing automation—we're ensuring the gains are shared.

## AI Governance Questions

### Q: Will this make AI development illegal or impossible?

**Short Answer:** Absolutely not. It just requires transparency and accountability for AI systems that make important decisions about people's lives.

**Full Answer:**
The Human Standard's AI governance framework:

**Does NOT:**
- Ban AI development
- Require government approval for AI research
- Prevent commercial AI deployment
- Apply to all AI systems

**DOES:**
- Require transparency for high-stakes AI (decisions about jobs, loans, bail, benefits)
- Give citizens the right to explanation and human appeal
- Mandate bias testing for government AI
- Require government AI to be open source
- Create accountability for AI harms

**Scope Limitations:**
- **Tier 1 (Strictest)**: AI affecting fundamental rights (criminal justice, benefits)
- **Tier 2**: AI with significant impact (credit, employment)
- **Tier 3**: AI with moderate impact (fraud detection, routing)
- **Tier 4**: Administrative AI (minimal requirements)

Research AI, entertainment AI, creative tools, and personal assistants face minimal regulation. The focus is on AI that makes decisions about people's rights and opportunities.

---

### Q: Won't requiring transparency expose trade secrets?

**Short Answer:** We balance transparency with legitimate IP protection through tiered disclosure, secure audit processes, and aggregate reporting.

**Full Answer:**
The framework includes multiple mechanisms to protect legitimate interests:

**Tiered Disclosure:**
- **Public**: General description, input categories, bias test results
- **Regulators**: Full technical specifications, training data info
- **Under Seal**: Actual source code, proprietary algorithms

**Practical Protections:**
- Third-party auditors with NDAs can verify compliance
- Explanations for individuals don't require disclosing full model
- Aggregate bias statistics, not individual predictions
- Competitive information protected unless public harm demonstrated

**Government AI Exception:**
- Government AI paid for by taxpayers is fully open source
- Private contractors for government must open-source government-specific components
- National security systems have classified exception with oversight

**The Trade-Off:**
If your AI decides whether someone gets a job, loan, or freedom, they have a right to understand why. The minor burden on trade secrets is outweighed by the public interest in accountable decisions.

---

### Q: Who decides what counts as "biased" AI?

**Short Answer:** Objective statistical measures based on existing civil rights frameworks, tested against protected categories with clear thresholds.

**Full Answer:**
Bias isn't subjective opinion—it's measurable:

**Measurement Framework:**
- **Disparate Impact**: Are outcomes significantly different across protected groups?
- **Equalized Odds**: Are error rates (false positives, false negatives) equal across groups?
- **Calibration**: Are confidence scores equally accurate across groups?
- **Individual Fairness**: Are similar individuals treated similarly?

**Thresholds:**
- **Tier 1 Systems**: No more than 10% disparity (stricter than 80% EEOC rule)
- **Tier 2 Systems**: No more than 20% disparity (matches EEOC standard)

**Protected Categories (from existing civil rights law):**
- Race, color, national origin
- Sex, gender identity, sexual orientation
- Religion
- Age
- Disability status
- Veteran status

**Process:**
- Regular testing using these metrics
- Results reported to regulators
- Significant disparities require mitigation plans
- Public aggregate data (privacy-protected)

This isn't about political opinions on bias—it's about objective measurement of differential outcomes.

## Sound Money Questions

### Q: Why Bitcoin? Isn't it volatile/speculative/used for crime?

**Short Answer:** Bitcoin is a non-sovereign store of value that can't be debased by governments. Volatility decreases as adoption increases. Criminal use is lower than cash and more traceable.

**Full Answer:**

**Why Bitcoin:**
1. **Non-Sovereign**: No government can print more Bitcoin or seize it unilaterally
2. **Scarce**: Fixed 21 million supply—cannot be inflated
3. **Decentralized**: No single point of failure or control
4. **Transparent**: All transactions visible on public blockchain
5. **Portable**: Can be moved anywhere instantly
6. **Divisible**: Usable for any transaction size

**On Volatility:**
- Volatility is a function of market cap and adoption maturity
- Gold was volatile before it became established
- Strategic reserve is long-term (10+ years)—short-term volatility irrelevant
- Dollar cost averaging over 10 years smooths entry price

**On Criminal Use:**
- Cash is far more anonymous than Bitcoin (blockchain is transparent)
- Less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions linked to illicit activity (Chainalysis)
- Law enforcement has developed sophisticated blockchain analysis
- Same argument was made against the internet, cash, and banks

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Other nations (El Salvador, now considering others) are adopting
- Digital gold for the digital age
- Hedge against dollar weakness or monetary instability
- Diversification of national reserves

---

### Q: Isn't a "robot tax" funding UBI basically printing money with extra steps?

**Short Answer:** No. The automation tax collects real revenue from real economic activity. It's not money creation—it's redistribution of productivity gains.

**Full Answer:**
There's a fundamental difference between:

**Money Printing (Inflationary):**
- Central bank creates new money
- More dollars chasing same goods
- Devalues existing money
- No corresponding increase in production

**Taxation and Transfer (Not Inflationary):**
- Collects money from one part of economy
- Transfers to another part
- No new money created
- Shifts who spends existing money

The automation tax:
- Collects revenue from companies benefiting from automation
- Transfers to citizens as UBI
- Total money supply unchanged
- Simply redirects purchasing power

**Why This Matters:**
- Printing money for UBI would be inflationary (we oppose this)
- Taxing automation to fund UBI is NOT inflationary—it's redistribution
- We're taking some of what would go to shareholders and redirecting to citizens
- Consumer spending may actually reduce inflation vs. QE (asset price inflation)

---

### Q: Why no CBDC? Other countries have them.

**Short Answer:** Central Bank Digital Currencies enable unprecedented financial surveillance and government control over spending. That's incompatible with freedom.

**Full Answer:**
CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) for retail use create dangerous capabilities:

**Surveillance Risks:**
- Every transaction visible to government
- Complete financial history of every citizen
- No cash-like anonymity possible
- Pattern analysis reveals intimate details of life

**Control Risks:**
- Programmable money can expire, be restricted, or be seized
- "Social credit" style systems become possible
- Accounts can be frozen without due process
- Monetary policy can target individuals

**China's Example:**
- Digital yuan enables comprehensive surveillance
- Linked to social credit system
- Spending can be restricted by category or location
- Demonstrates authoritarian potential

**Our Alternative:**
- Private stablecoins with regulatory oversight (not government-issued)
- Cash remains available for privacy
- Self-custody rights protected
- Digital payments possible without surveillance

**Wholesale CBDC Exception:**
We allow consideration of wholesale CBDCs (bank-to-bank) with limitations, as these don't create individual surveillance risks.

---

## Economic Objections

### Q: Won't UBI cause massive inflation if everyone has more money?

**Short Answer:** UBI is funded by taxes, not money printing. It shifts who spends money, not how much money exists. Putting money in consumer hands is less inflationary than QE.

**Full Answer:**
Inflation concerns confuse UBI with money printing:

**What Causes Inflation:**
1. More money chasing same goods (monetary expansion)
2. Supply constraints (not enough production)
3. Cost-push (input costs rise)

**Why UBI Doesn't Cause #1:**
- UBI is tax-funded, not printed
- Total money supply doesn't change
- It's redistribution, not creation

**Why UBI May Reduce Inflation vs. Alternatives:**
- Current monetary policy (QE) primarily inflates asset prices
- UBI puts money in hands of spenders, not savers
- Increased demand spurs supply response
- More evenly distributed demand is more stable

**Moderate Effects Possible:**
- Some price increases in inelastic goods (housing in constrained markets)
- Policy includes housing supply incentives to mitigate
- Overall consumer basket impact: minimal (1-2% during phase-in)

**Historical Evidence:**
- Alaska PFD hasn't caused notable Alaska-specific inflation
- COVID stimulus (far faster than UBI phase-in) caused modest, temporary inflation
- UBI phase-in over 10 years allows supply to adjust

### Q: How can you possibly afford $6 trillion a year?

**Short Answer:** The automation economy will generate trillions in productivity gains. We're capturing a portion of those gains, not creating new spending out of nothing.

**Full Answer:**
The math works because automation creates real wealth:

**Revenue Sources (Projected 2035):**
| Source | Annual Revenue |
|--------|----------------|
| Automation Productivity Tax | $400-600B |
| Data Dividend Tax | $80-100B |
| Carbon Fee Contribution | $100-150B |
| Reduced Program Costs | $300-400B |
| Economic Growth Effects | $200-400B |
| **Total** | **$1.1-1.7T** |

**Phased Cost:**
| Year | Monthly UBI | Annual Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Year 1 | $500 | $1.56T |
| Year 5 | $1,250 | $3.9T |
| Year 10 | $2,000 | $6.24T |

**How It Works:**
1. Revenue sources grow as automation expands
2. UBI phases in as revenue becomes available
3. Economic growth from UBI spending generates tax revenue
4. Reduced poverty reduces healthcare, criminal justice, emergency costs

**The Alternative Cost:**
- Mass unemployment from unmanaged automation: Incalculable
- Social unrest and political instability: Incalculable
- Lost human potential: Incalculable

We can afford it. We can't afford not to.

---

### Q: Won't companies just pass the automation tax to consumers?

**Short Answer:** Some pass-through will occur, but the tax is designed to minimize this. And consumers receive UBI, which more than offsets modest price increases.

**Full Answer:**
Economic reality of tax incidence:

**Factors Limiting Pass-Through:**
- Competition limits price increases
- Elastic demand for many products
- Automation tax is modest relative to labor cost savings
- Companies still profit substantially from automation

**Expected Pass-Through: 40-60%**
- Average household impact: $500-800/year in higher prices
- Average UBI benefit: $24,000-48,000/year per household
- Net benefit: $23,000-47,000/year

**Distribution Effect:**
- Pass-through is flat (same price increase for everyone)
- UBI is progressive (same benefit for everyone, but means more to poor)
- Low-income households gain dramatically
- High-income households: slight net cost (still positive for most)

**Design Features:**
- Exemptions for essentials (food production automation)
- Lower rates for low-margin industries
- Credits prevent extreme price spikes

The math works decisively in favor of consumers, especially those with lower incomes.

---

## Political Objections

### Q: This is socialism!

**Short Answer:** It's not. Private property stays private. Markets stay free. We're just ensuring everyone shares in technological progress.

**Full Answer:**
Let's be clear about what socialism is:

**Socialism:**
- Government/worker ownership of means of production
- Central planning of the economy
- Abolition of private property
- Elimination of markets

**The Human Standard:**
- Private ownership fully preserved
- Markets set prices and allocate resources
- Private property rights strengthened
- Government doesn't own or control businesses

**What We Actually Do:**
- Tax economic activity (like we already do)
- Distribute benefits to citizens (like Social Security)
- Regulate powerful systems (like we regulate banks)
- Protect individual rights (like the Constitution)

**Historical Parallel:**
When Social Security was proposed, critics called it socialism. When Medicare was proposed, critics called it socialism. Neither was. Neither is this.

**Conservative Support for Basic Income:**
- Milton Friedman (Negative Income Tax)
- Charles Murray (conservative political scientist)
- Many libertarian economists

This is capitalism that works for everyone, not socialism.

---

### Q: This is libertarian fantasy! Markets can't solve everything!

**Short Answer:** Agreed—that's why we have regulations, transparency requirements, and a social safety net. We're not libertarian; we're pragmatic.

**Full Answer:**
The Human Standard rejects ideological extremes:

**We Reject Laissez-Faire Because:**
- Markets produce externalities (pollution, displacement)
- Power imbalances undermine "free" transactions
- Technology can entrench inequality without intervention
- Some goods (safety, environment) require collective action

**We Use Markets Because:**
- Price signals allocate resources efficiently
- Competition drives innovation
- Decentralized decisions use local knowledge
- Freedom of exchange is a value

**Our Approach:**
- Markets for what markets do well
- Regulation for externalities and power imbalances
- Universal benefits for shared prosperity
- Democratic accountability for powerful systems

This is neither left nor right ideologically—it's pragmatic about what works.

---

### Q: Why should I trust government to run this? Government screws everything up.

**Short Answer:** Social Security has run for 90 years. Medicare works. Direct cash transfers are simple. And our policies include transparency and accountability mechanisms.

**Full Answer:**
Valid concerns deserve honest engagement:

**Government Does Some Things Well:**
- Social Security: 90+ years, widely popular, low overhead
- Medicare: Popular, lower overhead than private insurance
- Direct payments: IRS sent millions of stimulus checks successfully

**UBI Is Simple:**
- No complex eligibility determination
- No case workers making judgment calls
- Just direct deposit to verified citizens
- Minimal bureaucracy required

**Our Accountability Mechanisms:**
- Transparent budgets and audits
- Independent oversight boards
- Regular evaluation and adjustment
- Automatic triggers for sustainability

**Checks on Government Power:**
- No CBDC (prevents financial surveillance)
- Open source AI (prevents algorithmic oppression)
- Self-custody rights (keeps money beyond government reach)
- Constitutional constraints

We share skepticism of government. That's why our policies include checks against abuse.

---

## Philosophical Objections

### Q: Don't people need to work to have dignity and purpose?

**Short Answer:** People need *meaningful activity*, not necessarily *paid employment*. UBI enables purpose by freeing people to contribute beyond wage labor.

**Full Answer:**
This confuses work with jobs:

**Meaningful Work vs. Paid Employment:**
- Raising children is work, often unpaid
- Caring for elders is work, often unpaid
- Community involvement is work, unpaid
- Creating art is work, often unpaid
- Starting a business is work, initially unpaid

**What UBI Enables:**
- Parenting without poverty
- Caregiving without exploitation
- Creativity without starvation
- Entrepreneurship without homelessness
- Education without insurmountable debt

**What About Paid Work:**
- Most people will continue working for income above UBI
- the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) provides survival, not comfort
- Work will still provide additional income and social connection
- But people can say no to degrading or exploitative jobs

**The Real Dignity Question:**
What's more dignified—working a soul-crushing job out of terror, or choosing meaningful work because you have options?

---

### Q: Isn't this rewarding people for doing nothing?

**Short Answer:** It's recognizing that our collective technological heritage belongs to everyone. You didn't create the internet, roads, or rule of law alone—and neither did billionaires.

**Full Answer:**
Let's think about where wealth comes from:

**No One is Self-Made:**
- Every business uses roads taxpayers built
- Every technology builds on publicly-funded research
- Every company benefits from educated workers (public schools)
- Every transaction relies on rule of law (public courts)
- Every safe product benefits from regulations (public agencies)

**The Automation Wealth:**
- AI trained on the entire internet (collective human knowledge)
- Robots use technologies from public universities
- Companies automate tasks that required human training
- Productivity gains build on centuries of shared progress

**The Dividend Logic:**
- Alaska gives residents a share of oil wealth (collective resource)
- UBI gives citizens a share of automation wealth (collective heritage)
- It's not "something for nothing"—it's your inheritance

**Who's Really Getting "Something for Nothing":**
- Shareholders who capture all gains from automation
- Companies using public infrastructure for private profit
- Billionaires whose wealth derives from collective systems

---

### Q: What about people who make bad choices? Should we fund their bad decisions?

**Short Answer:** Everyone makes mistakes. The question is whether one mistake should lead to permanent destitution. UBI provides security while preserving consequences.

**Full Answer:**
This objection assumes:
1. Poverty is primarily caused by bad choices (often false)
2. Suffering is appropriate punishment for mistakes (debatable)
3. We can accurately judge whose choices were "bad" (we can't)

**Reality:**
- Most poverty results from circumstances, not choices
- Many "bad choices" reflect limited options
- Suffering doesn't usually improve future choices
- Children suffer for parents' circumstances

**What UBI Does:**
- Ensures basic needs regardless of past
- Preserves incentive to earn more through work
- Allows mistakes without life destruction
- Gives second chances

**What UBI Doesn't Do:**
- Fund addictions (but doesn't enable more than current poverty does)
- Eliminate consequences (still better to work for more money)
- Excuse harmful behavior (criminal justice still applies)

**The Alternative:**
Means-testing requires judging everyone's worthiness—invasive, expensive, and error-prone. Universality is simpler, fairer, and more dignified.

## Implementation Questions

### Q: How long would this take to implement?

**Short Answer:** Full implementation takes 10 years, with meaningful benefits beginning Year 1.

**Full Answer:**
**Timeline:**

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Foundation | Years 1-2 | Legislation, agency setup, initial enrollment |
| Launch | Year 3 | First payments ($500/month) |
| Scaling | Years 3-7 | Gradual increase, system refinement |
| Maturity | Years 8-10 | Full the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model), all systems operational |

**Why This Pace:**
- Revenue sources need time to scale
- Systems need time to build
- Economy needs time to adjust
- Allows learning and correction

**Day 1 Actions (Executive Authority):**
- Direct agencies to prepare implementation
- Establish working groups
- Begin enrollment system procurement
- Initiate automation census

---

### Q: What about immigrants/non-citizens?

**Short Answer:** UBI goes to citizens. Legal residents can earn eligibility after 5 years. Undocumented immigrants don't qualify, but immigration reform is a separate issue.

**Full Answer:**
**Eligibility Categories:**

| Status | UBI Eligibility |
|--------|-----------------|
| U.S. Citizens (adult) | Eligible |
| Permanent Residents (5+ years) | Eligible after residency period |
| Permanent Residents (<5 years) | Not eligible for UBI |
| Temporary Visa Holders | Not eligible |
| Undocumented | Not eligible |

**Rationale:**
- Citizenship creates mutual obligations
- Residency requirement prevents "benefit shopping"
- Clear rules prevent fraud
- Immigration policy separate from UBI policy

**Related Considerations:**
- Work permits unaffected—non-citizens can still work
- Tax obligations apply to all workers (including funding UBI)
- Child citizens of non-citizen parents are eligible
- Pathway to citizenship means pathway to UBI

## Hostile Questions (Debate Prep)

### Q: "You're basically a communist who wants to destroy America."

**Response:**
"Private property stays private. Markets stay free. I'm not seizing anything. I'm just saying that when robots take jobs, some of that profit should go to the workers who got replaced—not all of it to shareholders. Milton Friedman supported basic income. Is Milton Friedman a communist?"

### Q: "Your plan would bankrupt the country."

**Response:**
"Let me ask you something: what's your plan for when self-driving trucks eliminate 3 million trucking jobs? What's your plan for when AI handles customer service, legal research, and medical diagnosis?

The Human Standard has a plan that's funded by taxing the very automation that creates the need. Your plan is apparently to pretend it isn't happening. Which one of us is risking bankruptcy?"

### Q: "People should work for their money, period."

**Response:**
"I agree. And here's the thing—most people will keep working because the Citizen's Royalty (up to $12,000/year under the NIT model) doesn't buy you a comfortable life. It keeps you alive. But when a robot takes your job, shouldn't the robot at least pay some taxes? Right now, companies fire humans and hire robots and pay nothing for displacing those workers. Is that fair?"

### Q: "This is just buying votes with free money."

**Response:**
"It's universal. Everyone gets it—your voters and mine. And by the way, isn't cutting taxes for the wealthy also 'buying votes with money'? At least this goes to everyone equally."

### Q: "Silicon Valley will never go along with this."

**Response:**
"Some of the loudest voices for UBI come from Silicon Valley. Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and many others have said UBI is inevitable because of automation. They know what's coming. The question is whether we prepare or just let them accumulate everything."

### Q: "Why should I pay taxes so someone else can sit home?"

**Response:**
"You're already paying. You're paying for emergency rooms when the uninsured show up. You're paying for homeless services. You're paying for the criminal justice system that deals with desperate people. You're paying for the social instability that inequality creates.

UBI isn't more expensive—it's less expensive than dealing with the mess we have now. And it gives everyone a stake in the economy, including buying products from your business."

### Q: "What's stopping people from spending it all on drugs and alcohol?"

**Response:**
"Alaska has given residents money for 40 years. Are Alaskans all drug addicts? No. The overwhelming evidence from cash transfer programs worldwide is that people spend it on food, housing, education, and starting businesses.

And here's the thing—if someone does spend it poorly, they still only have $2,000 next month. They can't blow it all forever. It's not a windfall; it's a floor."
